    Given the list of existing states, determine whether or not the new state is represented in the list of existing states.

    existing states: """{existing_states}"""
    new state: """{state}"""

    If the new state is sufficiently similar to a value in the list of existing states, return that existing state value. If the new state is NOT sufficiently similar to anything in existing states, return "None". Output a single value only.
