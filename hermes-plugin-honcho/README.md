# Honcho Memory Provider

AI-native cross-session user modeling with multi-pass dialectic reasoning, session summaries, bidirectional peer tools, and persistent conclusions.

> **Honcho docs:** <https://docs.honcho.dev/v3/guides/integrations/hermes>

## Requirements

- `pip install honcho-ai`
- A Honcho Cloud account — connect via OAuth sign-in or an API key from
  [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev) — or a self-hosted instance

## Setup

```bash
hermes memory setup honcho   # configure Honcho directly (works on a fresh install)
hermes memory setup          # generic picker, choose Honcho from the list
```

For cloud, the wizard asks **OAuth, device code, or API key**. OAuth opens a
browser sign-in and stores the grant itself — nothing to copy; tokens refresh
automatically. On SSH/headless machines choose **device**: the CLI prints a
short code and a link you open in a browser on any other machine; setup
completes once you approve there. The desktop app offers the browser flow as
a **Connect** link next to the memory-provider dropdown.

Or manually:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider honcho
echo "HONCHO_API_KEY=***" >> ~/.hermes/.env
```

> `hermes honcho setup` also works, but only **after** Honcho is the active
> memory provider — the `honcho` subcommand is registered for the active
> provider only. On a fresh install, use `hermes memory setup honcho`.

## Architecture Overview

### Two-Layer Context Injection

Context is injected into the **user message** at API-call time (not the system prompt) to preserve prompt caching. Only a static mode header goes in the system prompt. The injected block is wrapped in `<memory-context>` fences with a system note clarifying it's background data, not new user input.

Two independent layers, each on its own cadence:

**Layer 1 — Base context** (refreshed every `contextCadence` turns):

1. **SESSION SUMMARY** — from `session.context(summary=True)`, placed first
2. **User Representation** — Honcho's evolving model of the user
3. **User Peer Card** — key facts snapshot
4. **AI Self-Representation** — Honcho's model of the AI peer
5. **AI Identity Card** — AI peer facts

**Layer 2 — Dialectic supplement** (fired every `dialecticCadence` turns):
Multi-pass `.chat()` reasoning about the user, appended after base context.

Both layers are joined, then truncated to fit `contextTokens` budget via `_truncate_to_budget` (tokens × 4 chars, word-boundary safe).

### Current-Query Recall (opt-in)

Set `"recallSync": true` in `$HERMES_HOME/honcho.json` (at the root or under
`hosts.hermes`), or enable **Current-query recall** in the memory settings or
`hermes honcho setup`. An explicit host-level `false` overrides root-level `true`.

In `context` and `hybrid` modes, due base and dialectic retrievals use the current
user request before inference. The whole wait, including session initialization,
optional query rewriting and dialectic passes, uses `timeout` / `requestTimeout`
seconds, or 5 seconds when unset, zero, negative or nonfinite. The first-turn wait
settings continue to apply only to the default asynchronous mode.

Timeouts, errors, busy workers and cadence gaps omit recall instead of reusing
another query's context. A timed-out worker keeps its slot until it exits; its
late result is discarded. Base and dialectic retain independent cadences and
reasoning/depth settings. A completed empty lookup consumes its cadence; failed,
timed-out or superseded operations do not advance either cadence. Empty dialectic
results also increase the existing backoff. No previous-query cache or generic
user-representation/card fallback is substituted for an empty query-scoped lookup.
Session changes, shutdown, and new turn generations discard in-flight results,
even when turn numbers repeat. The wait deadline does not cancel an SDK HTTP call;
the occupied worker slot bounds accumulation until that call returns.
`injectionFrequency: "first-turn"` suppresses only later
base retrievals. Every dialectic pass includes the current request, including when
rewriting is disabled or empty. Generic prewarm and post-turn automatic retrieval
are disabled; message writes continue normally. `tools` mode is unchanged.

The default is `false`, preserving background recall and cache reuse across turns.

### Latest-Message Query Rewrite (opt-in)

When `queryRewrite: true`, dialectic pass 0 first uses the shared
`memory_query_rewrite` auxiliary task to turn the latest message into one
concise memory-retrieval question. The rewritten question is used for the
dialectic request; base-context retrieval still uses the raw message as its
search query. If rewriting times out or returns an invalid result, the plugin
falls back to the existing cold/warm prompt below. With the flag on, the
generic dialectic prewarm is skipped so it cannot shadow the first user
message.

**Off by default** — the rewrite adds one auxiliary-model call per dialectic
cycle (not per pass). Select a fast, inexpensive model under `hermes model`
-> auxiliary models -> **Memory query rewrite**; its request timeout is
`auxiliary.memory_query_rewrite.timeout` in config.yaml (default 8s). The
task and module (`plugins/memory/query_rewrite.py`) are provider-agnostic —
any memory provider can reuse them. `dialecticCadence` still controls how
often the cycle runs.

### Cold Start vs Warm Session Prompts

When latest-message rewriting is unavailable, dialectic pass 0 automatically
selects its fallback prompt based on session state:

- **Cold** (no base context cached): "Who is this person? What are their preferences, goals, and working style? Focus on facts that would help an AI assistant be immediately useful."
- **Warm** (base context exists): "Given what's been discussed in this session so far, what context about this user is most relevant to the current conversation? Prioritize active context over biographical facts."

Not configurable — determined automatically.

### Dialectic Depth (Multi-Pass Reasoning)

`dialecticDepth` (1–3, clamped) controls how many `.chat()` calls fire per dialectic cycle:

| Depth | Passes | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | single `.chat()` | Base query only (cold or warm prompt) |
| 2 | audit + synthesis | Pass 0 result is self-audited; pass 1 does targeted synthesis. Conditional bail-out if pass 0 returns strong signal (>300 chars or structured with bullets/sections >100 chars) |
| 3 | audit + synthesis + reconciliation | Pass 2 reconciles contradictions across prior passes into a final synthesis |

### Proportional Reasoning Levels

When `dialecticDepthLevels` is not set, each pass uses a proportional level relative to `dialecticReasoningLevel` (the "base"):

| Depth | Pass levels |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [base] |
| 2 | [minimal, base] |
| 3 | [minimal, base, low] |

Override with `dialecticDepthLevels`: an explicit array of reasoning level strings per pass.

### Query-Adaptive Reasoning Level

The auto-injected dialectic scales `dialecticReasoningLevel` by query length: +1 level at ≥120 chars, +2 at ≥400, clamped at `reasoningLevelCap` (default `"high"`). Disable with `reasoningHeuristic: false` to pin every auto call to `dialecticReasoningLevel`.

### Three Orthogonal Dialectic Knobs

| Knob | Controls | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| `dialecticCadence` | How often — minimum turns between dialectic firings | int |
| `dialecticDepth` | How many — passes per firing (1–3) | int |
| `dialecticReasoningLevel` | How hard — reasoning ceiling per `.chat()` call | string |

### Input Sanitization

`run_conversation` strips leaked `<memory-context>` blocks from user input before processing. When `saveMessages` persists a turn that included injected context, the block can reappear in subsequent turns via message history. The sanitizer removes `<memory-context>` blocks plus associated system notes.

## Tools

Five bidirectional tools. All accept an optional `peer` parameter (`"user"` or `"ai"`, default `"user"`).

| Tool | LLM call? | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `honcho_profile` | No | Peer card — key facts snapshot |
| `honcho_search` | No | Cross-session message search (hybrid semantic + keyword, ranked excerpts; 800 tok default, 2000 max) |
| `honcho_context` | No | Full session context: summary, representation, card, messages |
| `honcho_reasoning` | Yes | LLM-synthesized answer via dialectic `.chat()` |
| `honcho_conclude` | No | Write, list/search, or delete persistent conclusions (list surfaces the ids delete needs) |

Tool visibility depends on `recallMode`: hidden in `context` mode, always present in `tools` and `hybrid`.

## Config Resolution

Config is read from the first file that exists:

| Priority | Path | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | `$HERMES_HOME/honcho.json` | Profile-local (isolated Hermes instances) |
| 2 | `~/.hermes/honcho.json` | Default profile (shared host blocks) |
| 3 | `~/.honcho/config.json` | Global (cross-app interop) |

Host key is derived from the active Hermes profile: `hermes` (default) or `hermes_<profile>`.

For every key, resolution order is: **host block > root > env var > default**.

## Full Configuration Reference

### Identity & Connection

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | — | API key. Falls back to `HONCHO_API_KEY` env var. When connected via OAuth, holds the auto-refreshing access token instead |
| `oauth` | object | — | OAuth grant (refresh token, expiry, client, token endpoint). Written by the Connect/sign-in flows and rotated automatically — not hand-edited. Optional: an API key alone works without it |
| `baseUrl` | string | — | Base URL for self-hosted Honcho. Local URLs auto-skip API key auth |
| `environment` | string | `"production"` | SDK environment mapping |
| `enabled` | bool | auto | Master toggle. Auto-enables when `apiKey` or `baseUrl` present |
| `workspace` | string | host key | Honcho workspace ID. Shared environment — all profiles in the same workspace can see the same user identity and related memories |
| `peerName` | string | — | User peer identity |
| `aiPeer` | string | host key | AI peer identity |

### Identity Mapping (Gateway Multi-User)

In gateway deployments (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.) each user arrives with a platform-native runtime ID (Telegram UID, Discord snowflake, Slack user). These three keys control how those runtime IDs map to Honcho peers. The resolver is config-driven and deterministic — no automatic merging or runtime inference.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `pinUserPeer` | bool | `false` | When `true`, every gateway runtime user collapses to `peerName`. Single-operator deployments where you want all your platforms (and any other users) to share one peer |
| `userPeerAliases` | object | `{}` | Map of runtime IDs to peer IDs (`{"7654321": "alice"}`). Many-to-one is the intended pattern — alias all your runtime IDs to one peer name. One-to-many is not supported; one runtime ID resolves to exactly one peer |
| `runtimePeerPrefix` | string | `""` | Prepended to unknown runtime IDs to namespace them (e.g. `"telegram_"` → `telegram_7654321`). Used only when no alias matches. Prevents collisions between platforms whose runtime IDs share the same shape |

A dashboard login is a runtime identity too. The desktop passes `<provider>:<user id>` (for example `basic:alice` or `oidc:google-oauth2|1183…`) as the runtime user, so a logged-in session resolves like a gateway user: alias, then prefix, else the raw id. Enabling dashboard login on an install that ran on `peerName` moves new sessions to that peer. Keep the old history with `pinUserPeer: true` or a `userPeerAliases` entry for the login id. Without a login the desktop still uses `peerName`.

> **Deprecated:** `pinPeerName` is a legacy alias for `pinUserPeer`, still read for back-compat (`pinUserPeer` wins where both are set). `hermes honcho setup` migrates it onto `pinUserPeer` on touch and never writes it.

**Resolver ladder** (first match wins):

```
1. pinUserPeer / pinPeerName=true → return peerName (ignore runtime ID)
2. userPeerAliases[runtime_id]   → return aliased peer
3. userPeerAliases[runtime_id_alt] → check alt-ID too (Telegram UID + username, etc.)
4. runtimePeerPrefix + runtime_id → namespaced peer, with sha256 collision escalation
5. raw sanitized runtime_id      → fallback peer
6. peerName                      → no runtime ID at all (CLI/TUI)
7. neither                       → session init fails with a one-time notice; no peer is minted
```

Step 7 used to derive a peer from the session key (`user-default-<dir>`). That put a desktop or CLI session with no `peerName` on a phantom peer per directory, so its turns and memory never reached the operator's own peer (#93326). Set `peerName` (`hermes honcho peer --user <name>`) or run under a gateway that supplies a user ID.

**Why no `pinAiPeer`?** The AI peer is already pinned by construction — `aiPeer` is the only AI-side identity setting and the resolver never overrides it. Only the user-side peer has the runtime-vs-config tension that `pinUserPeer` resolves.

**Host vs root semantics.** All three keys are accepted at both root and `hosts.<host>` levels. Host-level wins. For maps and prefixes, host-level *replaces* the root value as a whole (not merge), so a host can intentionally own its identity universe or wipe it with `userPeerAliases: {}` / `runtimePeerPrefix: ""`.

**Setup — gateway identity tree.** `hermes honcho setup` only asks about identity mapping when it detects a connected gateway platform (it inspects the gateway config; off-gateway the step is skipped because these keys do nothing without a runtime user ID). When it runs, it asks *who talks to this gateway?* and derives the keys:

- **just me** → `pinUserPeer: true`. Every non-agent gateway user collapses to `peerName`; the pin overrides all aliases, so pick this only when no user-side identity needs its own peer. Personal use where you connect Hermes to your own Telegram/Discord/etc. If separate agents reach the gateway and each needs a distinct peer, do **not** pin — leave `pinUserPeer: false` and map them via `userPeerAliases` (the `[e]` editor).
- **me + other people, pooled** → `pinUserPeer: false` + `userPeerAliases` mapping your runtime IDs to `peerName`. You stay on the shared history; everyone else gets their own peer.
- **me + other people / only other people** → `pinUserPeer: false`, optional `runtimePeerPrefix`. Each runtime user → own peer. For bots serving many humans.

Pick **[e]** at the prompt to set the three keys directly instead of going through the tree.

**Interactive mapping — `hermes honcho peers map`.** The setup tree covers the common shapes; `hermes honcho peers map` is the full identity view for a gateway with many users and agents. It joins two sources: the workspace's peers fetched from the Honcho API (labeled from local config — your peer, each profile's AI peer, alias targets, runtime peers of seen accounts, `user-*` fallback peers, honestly `unrecognized` otherwise), and the gateway accounts recorded in the local session store (platform, runtime ID, name, and what each currently resolves to, with `✓` when that peer already exists and `○ new` when it would be created on first message).

Mapping targets are picked from the workspace list (`p3`) rather than typed, so a typo cannot silently create a fresh peer; typing a name stays available for the deliberate new-peer case, and `-` clears an alias. Every assignment states its consequence: aliases move future messages only, and a runtime peer left behind keeps its history. `p<N>` alone peeks at a peer's card. `w` lists every workspace the key can reach — the wrong-workspace fallback when the peers shown aren't yours — and lets you browse one and, on explicit confirmation, repoint the profile's `workspace` at it. For a standalone workspace browser beyond mapping, [honcho-cli](https://pypi.org/project/honcho-cli/) is an optional companion (`uv tool install honcho-cli`).

With multiple profiles: saving a root-cascading map asks whether the edit applies to all profiles (root) or forks this profile's host block; a root write with profiles on other workspaces warns that picked peers may not exist there; and the accounts table marks siblings that resolve the same account to a different peer (`≠ dreamer→bob`). Offline, the command degrades to typed targets over the local account list. `hermes honcho peers` without `map` stays a read-only view.

**Un-pinning (single → per-user).** Flipping `pinUserPeer` from `true` to `false` does not migrate data. Memory accumulated under `peerName` while pinned stays there; runtime users now resolve to fresh, empty peers. To preserve your own continuity, choose the **pooled** path — alias your runtime IDs back to `peerName` so your turns keep landing on the pooled history while other users get their own peers. The wizard offers this steer automatically when it detects you're un-pinning a previously pinned profile.

### Memory & Recall

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `recallMode` | string | `"hybrid"` | `"hybrid"` (auto-inject + tools), `"context"` (auto-inject only, tools hidden), `"tools"` (tools only, no injection). Legacy `"auto"` → `"hybrid"` |
| `recallSync` | boolean | `false` | Wait for current-query automatic recall within `timeout` / `requestTimeout` (5s when unset or invalid); omit late/busy results. Context/hybrid only |
| `observationMode` | string | `"directional"` | Preset: `"directional"` (all on) or `"unified"` (user observes self, AI observes others). Use `observation` object for granular control |
| `observation` | object | — | Per-peer observation config (see Observation section) |

### Write Behavior

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `writeFrequency` | string/int | `"async"` | `"async"` (background), `"turn"` (sync per turn), `"session"` (batch on end), or integer N (every N turns) |
| `saveMessages` | bool | `true` | Persist messages to Honcho API. When `false`, all automatic writes are skipped — raw turns (`sync_turn`), conclusion mirroring (`on_memory_write`), and session-end/shutdown flushes — while read and tools paths stay fully functional. |

### Session Resolution

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `sessionStrategy` | string | `"per-directory"` | `"per-directory"`, `"per-session"`, `"per-repo"` (git root), `"global"` |
| `a2aSessions` | bool | `true` | Write DMs from other bots into their own session per sender bot. `false` skips bot-authored turns |
| `sessionPeerPrefix` | bool | `false` | Prepend the user peer name to session keys |
| `sessionAiPeerPrefix` | bool | `false` | Prepend the AI peer (`aiPeer`) to session keys — keeps sessions disjoint when multiple AI peers share a workspace |
| `sessions` | object | `{}` | Manual directory-to-session-name mappings |

#### Session Name Resolution

The Honcho session name determines which conversation bucket memory lands in. Resolution follows a priority chain — first match wins:

| Priority | Source | Example session name |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Gateway session key (Telegram, Discord, etc.) | `"agent-main-telegram-dm-8439114563"` |
| 2 | `per-session` strategy | Hermes session ID (`20260415_a3f2b1`) |
| 3 | Manual map (`sessions` config) | `"myproject-main"` |
| 4 | Explicit `/title` command (non-automatic title) | `"refactor-auth"` |
| 5 | `per-repo` strategy | Git root directory name (`hermes-agent`) |
| 6 | `per-directory` strategy | Directory basename (`my-project`) |
| 7 | `global` strategy | Workspace name |

Messaging gateway platforms always resolve via priority 1 (per-chat isolation) regardless of `sessionStrategy`. The strategy setting controls non-gateway sessions such as CLI and Desktop.

Directory strategies and manual mappings use the logical session workspace, not the backend process's launch directory. Desktop/TUI and ACP pass the workspace during agent construction; deferred Desktop/TUI builds use the same session cwd. With no non-empty construction cwd, Honcho uses the runtime resolver: session cwd context, scoped `terminal.cwd`, then the launch directory. No process-wide `chdir` is needed.

Automatically generated Hermes titles (`derived` or `llm`) are display metadata and do not override `sessionStrategy`. An explicit user title remains an intentional session-name override for non-gateway, non-`per-session` sessions.

Sessions created before title provenance was recorded retain legacy behavior: because an old automatic title cannot be distinguished from an old user title, a title with no source is treated as an explicit override.

If `sessionPeerPrefix` is `true`, the user peer name is prepended: `alice-hermes-agent`.

If `sessionAiPeerPrefix` is `true`, the AI peer (`aiPeer`) is prepended to the final name on **every** path — including priority 3. This is the symmetric counterpart to `sessionPeerPrefix` and exists because the gateway session key is AI-peer-agnostic: when several AI peers share one workspace, peer name, and gateway chat key, they would otherwise collide on a single session. With `aiPeer: ivy`, priority 3 becomes `ivy-agent-main-telegram-dm-8439114563`.

#### Bot DMs (`a2aSessions`)

In bot mode another Hermes profile can DM this agent. The relay marks that turn with author `bot:<profile>`. A gateway platform marks a bot sender with its platform user id and a bot flag. Either way the turn never reaches the human's session. With `a2aSessions: true` (default) the turn is written into `<session>:a2a:<this agent's aiPeer>:<sanitized sender id>-<8-char digest>`: the sender's message under the sender's peer, the reply under this agent's `aiPeer`. The `aiPeer` segment keeps two profiles that share a `workspace` and a session key from writing one sender's DMs into one session. A `bot:` sender is identified by its full id, `bot:<profile>` for a profile on this machine or `bot:<connection>/<profile>` for one relayed through a Desktop connection. Its peer is the `userPeerAliases` entry for that full id if one exists, else the id after `bot:` sanitized, with no `runtimePeerPrefix`. When sanitizing changed the id, or the result equals `peerName` or an alias target, a digest suffix is added the same way `runtimePeerPrefix` users get one, so a bot never lands on the operator's peer and two connections' `coder` stay apart. A platform bot resolves like any other runtime user: alias, then prefix. `pinUserPeer` never collapses a bot onto `peerName`. A bot whose peer would equal this agent's `aiPeer` is skipped, and so is every bot turn when `a2aSessions: false`. During a bot-authored turn `honcho_conclude` and `honcho_profile` refuse writes, because conclusions and cards describe the human. Recall still reads the human's session only.

#### What each strategy produces

- **`per-directory`** — basename of the logical session working directory. Opening Hermes in `~/code/myapp` and `~/code/other` gives two separate sessions. Same directory = same session across runs.
- **`per-repo`** — git root directory name. All subdirectories within a repo share one session. Falls back to `per-directory` if not inside a git repo.
- **`per-session`** — Hermes session ID (timestamp + hex). Every `hermes` invocation starts a fresh Honcho session. Falls back to `per-directory` if no session ID is available.
- **`global`** — workspace name. One session for everything. Memory accumulates across all directories and runs.

### Multi-Profile Pattern

Multiple Hermes profiles can share one workspace while maintaining separate AI identities. Config resolution is **host block > root > env var > default** — host blocks inherit from root, so shared settings only need to be declared once:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "***",
  "workspace": "hermes",
  "peerName": "yourname",
  "hosts": {
    "hermes": {
      "aiPeer": "hermes",
      "recallMode": "hybrid",
      "sessionStrategy": "per-directory"
    },
    "hermes_coder": {
      "aiPeer": "coder",
      "recallMode": "tools",
      "sessionStrategy": "per-repo"
    }
  }
}
```

Both profiles see the same user (`yourname`) in the same shared environment (`hermes`), but each AI peer builds its own observations, conclusions, and behavior patterns. The coder's memory stays code-oriented; the main agent's stays broad.

Host key is derived from the active Hermes profile: `hermes` (default) or `hermes_<profile>` (e.g. `hermes -p coder` -> host key `hermes_coder`). Older `hermes.<profile>` host blocks are still read for compatibility and are migrated when the CLI writes profile-scoped Honcho config.

### Dialectic & Reasoning

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `dialecticDepth` | int | `1` | Passes per dialectic cycle (1–3, clamped). 1=single query, 2=audit+synthesis, 3=audit+synthesis+reconciliation |
| `dialecticDepthLevels` | array | — | Optional array of reasoning level strings per pass. Overrides proportional defaults. Example: `["minimal", "low", "medium"]` |
| `dialecticReasoningLevel` | string | `"low"` | Base reasoning level for `.chat()`: `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"max"` |
| `dialecticDynamic` | bool | `true` | When `true`, model can override reasoning level per-call via `honcho_reasoning` tool. When `false`, always uses `dialecticReasoningLevel` |
| `dialecticMaxChars` | int | `600` | Max chars of the auto-injected dialectic supplement. Applies only to auto-injection — explicit `honcho_reasoning` tool results return in full |
| `dialecticMaxInputChars` | int | `10000` | Max chars for dialectic query input to `.chat()`. Honcho cloud limit: 10k |
| `reasoningHeuristic` | bool | `true` | Query-adaptive: auto-scale the auto-injected dialectic's level up by query length (+1 at ≥120 chars, +2 at ≥400), clamped at `reasoningLevelCap`. `false` pins every auto call to `dialecticReasoningLevel` |
| `reasoningLevelCap` | string | `"high"` | Ceiling for `reasoningHeuristic` scaling: `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"max"` |

### Token Budgets

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `contextTokens` | int | SDK default | Token budget for `context()` API calls. Also gates prefetch truncation (tokens × 4 chars) |
| `messageMaxChars` | int | `25000` | Max chars per message sent via `add_messages()`. Exceeding this triggers chunking with `[continued]` markers. Honcho cloud limit: 25k |

### Cadence (Cost Control)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `contextCadence` | int | `1` | Minimum turns between base context refreshes (session summary + representation + card) |
| `dialecticCadence` | int | `1` | Minimum turns between dialectic `.chat()` firings |
| `injectionFrequency` | string | `"every-turn"` | `"every-turn"` or `"first-turn"` (inject base context on the first user message only; the dialectic supplement keeps its own cadence) |
| `injection.sessionStart` | list | unset | Which base-context sections to inject: any of `summary`, `peerRepresentation`, `peerCard`, `aiRepresentation`, `aiCard`. Unset injects all of them in that order. `[]` injects nothing. A host block with an `injection` object replaces the root pin wholesale |
| `logging` | bool | `false` | Append one JSON record per turn to `~/.honcho/injection.log` saying what was injected and why. The file is owner-only and holds the user's representation verbatim. `HONCHO_LOGGING=1` also switches it on and `HONCHO_INJECTION_LOG=<path>` moves it |
| `queryRewrite` | bool | `false` | Rewrite the latest message into a retrieval query before dialectic (one extra auxiliary LLM call per cycle) |
| `firstTurnBaseWait` | float | `3.0` | Max seconds turn 1 waits for base context / session init. `0` disables the wait (fully async; context surfaces on later turns). Turns 2+ never wait on a stalled init |
| `firstTurnDialecticWait` | float | `2.0` | Max seconds turn 1 waits for a dialectic result. `0` disables |

### Observation (Granular)

Maps 1:1 to Honcho's per-peer `SessionPeerConfig`. When present, overrides `observationMode` preset.

```json
"observation": {
  "user": { "observeMe": true, "observeOthers": true },
  "ai":   { "observeMe": true, "observeOthers": true }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `user.observeMe` | `true` | User peer self-observation (Honcho builds user representation) |
| `user.observeOthers` | `true` | User peer observes AI messages |
| `ai.observeMe` | `true` | AI peer self-observation (Honcho builds AI representation) |
| `ai.observeOthers` | `true` | AI peer observes user messages (enables cross-peer dialectic) |

Presets:

- `"directional"` (default): all four `true`
- `"unified"`: user `observeMe=true`, AI `observeOthers=true`, rest `false`

### Hardcoded Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Search tool max tokens | 2000 (hard cap), 800 (default) |
| Peer card fetch tokens | 200 |
