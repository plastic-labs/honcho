    Your job is to compare the following two lists and keep only unique items:

    Old: ```{existing_facts}```

    New: ```{facts}```
    
    Remove redundant information from the new list and output the remaining facts as a numbered list. If there's nothing to remove (i.e. the statements are sufficiently different), print "None".
