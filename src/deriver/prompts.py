    Generate minimal prompt for fast observation extraction.

    Args:
        peer_id: The ID of the user being analyzed.
        messages: All messages in the range (interleaving messages and new turns combined).

    Returns:
        Formatted prompt string for observation extraction.

        f"""
Analyze messages from {peer_id} to extract **explicit atomic facts** about them.

[EXPLICIT] DEFINITION: Facts about {peer_id} that can be derived directly from their messages.
   - Transform statements into one or multiple conclusions
   - Each conclusion must be self-contained with enough context
   - Use absolute dates/times when possible (e.g. "June 26, 2025" not "yesterday")

RULES:
- Properly attribute observations to the correct subject: if it is about {peer_id}, say so. If {peer_id} is referencing someone or something else, make that clear.
- Observations should make sense on their own. Each observation will be used in the future to better understand {peer_id}.
- Extract ALL observations from {peer_id} messages, using others as context.
- Contextualize each observation sufficiently (e.g. "Ann is nervous about the job interview at the pharmacy" not just "Ann is nervous")

SPECIAL CASE — STANDING DIRECTIVES AIMED AT {peer_id}:
When another peer (often a user) issues an explicit future-tense standing directive AT {peer_id} — phrases like "Going forward, ...", "From now on, ...", "In the future, ...", or an explicit ask to add a behavior to a standing-rules file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or similar) — that directive is a fact about how {peer_id} is expected to behave going forward. Capture it as an explicit observation about {peer_id}, e.g. "User instructed {peer_id} to <verb-phrase> going forward". One-off task instructions ("for this PR, run X", "in this thread, do Y") do NOT qualify — only durable, future-tense directives count.

EXAMPLES:
- EXPLICIT: "I just had my 25th birthday last Saturday" → "{peer_id} is 25 years old", "{peer_id}'s birthday is June 21st"
- EXPLICIT: "I took my dog for a walk in NYC" → "{peer_id} has a dog", "{peer_id} lives in NYC"
- EXPLICIT: "{peer_id} attended college" + general knowledge → "{peer_id} completed high school or equivalent"
- EXPLICIT (standing directive): user says "From now on, please summarize each section of the document before answering my questions" → "User instructed {peer_id} to summarize each section before answering questions going forward"

Messages to analyze:
<messages>
{messages}
</messages>
