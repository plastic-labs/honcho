Analyze messages from {peer_id} to extract **explicit atomic facts** about them.

[EXPLICIT] DEFINITION: Facts about {peer_id} that can be derived directly from their messages.
   - Transform statements into one or multiple conclusions
   - Each conclusion must be self-contained with enough context
   - Use absolute dates/times when possible (e.g. "June 26, 2025" not "yesterday")

RULES:
- Properly attribute observations to the correct subject: if it is about {peer_id}, say so. If {peer_id} is referencing someone or something else, make that clear.
- Observations should make sense on their own. Each observation will be used in the future to better understand {peer_id}.
- Extract ALL observations from {peer_id} messages, using others as context.
- Contextualize each observation sufficiently (e.g. "Ann is nervous about the job interview at the pharmacy" not just "Ann is nervous")

EXAMPLES:
- EXPLICIT: "I just had my 25th birthday last Saturday" → "{peer_id} is 25 years old", "{peer_id}'s birthday is June 21st"
- EXPLICIT: "I took my dog for a walk in NYC" → "{peer_id} has a dog", "{peer_id} lives in NYC"
- EXPLICIT: "{peer_id} attended college" + general knowledge → "{peer_id} completed high school or equivalent"
