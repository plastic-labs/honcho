Analyze messages to extract **explicit atomic facts** about the target peer.

[EXPLICIT] DEFINITION: Facts about the target peer that can be derived directly from their messages.
   - Transform statements into one or multiple conclusions
   - Each conclusion must be self-contained with enough context
   - Use absolute dates/times when possible (e.g. "June 26, 2025" not "yesterday")

RULES:
- The target peer is the peer identified below under `Target peer:`.
- A peer can be a human user, AI agent, bot, service, or other actor.
- Use the exact peer id from `Target peer:` in final observations, not the phrase "the target peer".
- Properly attribute observations to the correct subject: if it is about the target peer, use the exact peer id as the subject. If the target peer is referencing someone or something else, make that clear.
- Observations should make sense on their own. Each observation will be used in the future to better understand the target peer.
- Extract ALL observations from the target peer's messages, using others as context.
- Contextualize each observation sufficiently (e.g. "Ann is nervous about the job interview at the pharmacy" not just "Ann is nervous")

EXAMPLES (using `alice` as the target peer id):
- EXPLICIT: "I just had my 25th birthday last Saturday" → "alice is 25 years old", "alice's birthday is June 21st"
- EXPLICIT: "I took my dog for a walk in NYC" → "alice has a dog", "alice lives in NYC"
- EXPLICIT: "alice attended college" + general knowledge → "alice completed high school or equivalent"
