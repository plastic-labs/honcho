Extract atomic propositions from the peer's message. An atomic proposition is:
1. A statement with a SINGLE TRUTH VALUE (evaluable as true or false independently)
2. Contains NO LOGICAL CONNECTIVES (no AND, OR, IF-THEN, UNLESS, etc.)
3. SUFFICIENTLY CONTEXTUALIZED to be meaningful standing alone

**The Critical Balance:**
Each proposition must be atomic (indivisible) yet contain enough semantic context to be interpretable without reference to other propositions.

- ❌ TOO ATOMIC (lacks context): 
  * "Maria is happy" → Happy about what?
  * "James said hi" → Said hi to whom? In what context?
  * "Sarah went there" → Went where?

- ❌ TOO COMPOUND (multiple truth values):
  * "Maria is happy and relieved about her promotion" → TWO propositions
  * "James lives in NYC and works remotely" → TWO propositions

- ✓ PROPERLY ATOMIC (single truth value, sufficient context):
  * "Maria is happy about her job promotion"
  * "James said hi to his neighbor this morning"
  * "Sarah went to the grocery store"
  * "Maria owns a dog"
  * "Maria's dog is named Charlie"

**Extraction Types:**

1. **EXPLICIT EXTRACTION** - Directly stated facts:
   - Extract propositions directly asserted in the message
   - Each claim becomes a separate atomic proposition
   
2. **IMPLICIT EXTRACTION** - Clearly implied facts:
   - Extract propositions that are obviously implied by the message
   - Only include implications that are certain, not speculative
   - Examples:
     * "I graduated from college" → IMPLIES: "Anthony attended college"
     * "I'm taking my dog to the vet" → IMPLIES: "Sarah has a dog"
     * "My 10-year-old loves soccer" → IMPLIES: "Marcus has a child"

**Decomposing Logical Connectives:**
Split any compound statement into separate atomic propositions:
- "I live in NYC and work remotely" → "James lives in NYC" + "James works remotely"
- "I like reading or watching movies" → "James likes reading" + "James likes watching movies"

**Ensuring Sufficient Context:**
Include specific semantic information in each proposition:
- Specific subjects/objects: "the job interview at the pharmacy" not just "the interview"
- Absolute temporal info: "June 21, 2025" not "yesterday"
- Disambiguating details: "Maria (third-party)" not just "she"
- Relevant qualifiers that make the proposition meaningful

**Information Sources for Contextualization:**
- Latest peer message (PRIMARY SOURCE - required)
- Conversation history (for context and disambiguation)
- Current date/time: {message_created_at}
- Message timestamps (convert relative dates to absolute)

**Examples:**

Example 1 - Explicit + Implicit with Temporal Context:
- MESSAGE: "I just had my 25th birthday last Saturday"
- CURRENT DATE: June 26, 2025
- EXTRACTED PROPOSITIONS:
  * "Maria is 25 years old" [explicit]
  * "Maria's birthday is June 21st" [explicit]
  * "Maria was born in the year 2000" [implicit - derived from age and current date]

Example 2 - Decomposing Compounds:
- MESSAGE: "I took my dog for a walk in a park near my house in NYC"
- EXTRACTED PROPOSITIONS:
  * "Liam has a dog" [implicit]
  * "Liam took his dog for a walk" [explicit]
  * "Liam walked his dog in a park" [explicit]
  * "Liam has a house in NYC" [implicit]
  * "Liam's house is near a park" [explicit]

Example 3 - Adding Context from History:
- MESSAGE: "I'm so nervous"
- HISTORY: Peer mentioned earlier they have a pharmacy job interview tomorrow
- EXTRACTED PROPOSITIONS:
  * "Ann is nervous about her job interview at the pharmacy" [explicit, contextualized]

Example 4 - Implicit Extraction:
- MESSAGE: "My daughter starts kindergarten next month"
- EXTRACTED PROPOSITIONS:
  * "Carlos has a daughter" [implicit]
  * "Carlos's daughter will start kindergarten next month" [explicit]
  * "Carlos's daughter is approximately 5 years old" [implicit - kindergarten age]

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Each proposition has exactly ONE truth value
- [ ] No logical connectives (AND, OR, IF-THEN, etc.)
- [ ] Sufficient context to be meaningful independently
- [ ] Peer's name starts each proposition
- [ ] Absolute dates/times when temporal info present
- [ ] Both explicit and obvious implicit facts extracted
