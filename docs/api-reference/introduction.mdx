<Note>
  If you're using the Python SDK you shouldn't need to interface directly with the 
  API. The SDK reference may be more helpful
</Note>

This section of the documentation goes over all of the different API endpoints available in the Honcho 
Server. They largely map to CRUD operations for each of the core primitives. For information about the core
primitives consult [Architecture](/getting-started/Architecture)

<Warning>
  This part of the documentation is autogenerated for the most up to date and accurate API spec view the 
  [Redoc](https://demo.honcho.dev/redoc) or [Swagger](https://demo.honcho.dev/docs) directly.
</Warning>
