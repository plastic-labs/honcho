This section of the documentation goes over all of the different API endpoints available in the Honcho 
Server. They largely map to CRUD operations for each of the core primitives. For information about the core
primitives consult [Architecture](/getting-started/Architecture)

<Warning>
  This part of the documentation is autogenerated for the most up to date and accurate API spec view the 
  [Redoc](https://demo.honcho.dev/redoc) or [Swagger](https://demo.honcho.dev/docs) directly.
</Warning>

Each API endpoint is documented and includes code examples of how to interact with them via our [NodeJS](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho-node) and
[Python](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho-python) SDKs.

For more detailed looks on how the SDKs work and their associated types consult the api docs in each respective repository.
