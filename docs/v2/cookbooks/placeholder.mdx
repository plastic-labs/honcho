- Context-aware RAG applications
- Long-term memory for autonomous agents

### Advanced Use Cases
- Psychological profiling for adaptive UX
- Social dynamics in multi-peer systems
- Custom theory-of-mind implementations
- Hybrid memory architectures

### Integration Examples
- Integrating with popular frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex)
- Combining Honcho with vector databases
- Using webhooks for real-time updates
- Scaling Honcho for production
