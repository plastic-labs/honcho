You can let Claude use Honcho to manage its own memory in the native desktop app by using the Honcho MCP integration! Follow these steps:

1. Clone the `honcho` repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho.git
```

2. Navigate into the `mcp` folder.

```
cd mcp
```

3. Sync the virtual environment. This package uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) if you haven't.

```
uv sync
```

4. Get an API key from [honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)

5. Run FastMCP to install the Honcho MCP server in Claude Desktop:

```
uv pip install fastmcp
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --env-var HONCHO_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

<Note>You can easily install Honcho MCP in claude-code or cursor by replacing `claude-desktop` in the above command with either of those values</Note>

<Warning>Make sure Claude Desktop has access to `uv` on your system. You can get the location by running `which uv` on MacOS/Linux or `where uv` on Windows.</Warning>

6. Restart the Claude Desktop app. Upon relaunch, it should start Honcho and the tools should be available!

## Project Instructions

Finally, Claude needs instructions on how to use Honcho. The Desktop app doesn't allow you to add system prompts directly, but you can create a project and paste these [instructions](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho-mcp/blob/main/instructions.txt) into the "Project Instructions" field.

<Note>Be sure to update the \<app_name\> and \<user_name\> variables in the instructions.txt file.</Note>

Claude should then query for insights before responding and write your messages to storage! If you come up with more creative ways to get Claude to manage its own memory with Honcho, feel free to [let us know](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs) or make a PR on this [repo](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho-mcp/tree/main)!
