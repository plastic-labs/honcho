## Philosophy

These aren't just API documentation - they're implementation patterns that solve real problems. Each spellbook focuses on a specific use case with working code you can adapt to your needs.

The goal is to get you from idea to working prototype as quickly as possible, then provide the depth you need to scale and customize.
