<Note> Before you start a tutorial, follow [Quickstart](/v2/documentation/introduction/quickstart) to get up and running with Honcho in your language of choice. </Note>

AI development often feels like magic - you craft the right prompt and get exactly what you need. Our Spellbooks are practical guides that show you how to cast effective spells with Honcho.

Whether you're integrating Honcho into existing platforms, exploring advanced features, or getting up and running quickly, these guides provide concrete examples and implementation patterns.

Each spellbook focuses on a specific use case with working code you can adapt to your needs. The goal is to get you from idea to working prototype as quickly as possible, then provide the depth you need to scale and customize.
