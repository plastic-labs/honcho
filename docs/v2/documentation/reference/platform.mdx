## Welcome to Honcho!

To make developing with honcho as easy as possible [The Honcho Platform](https://app.honcho.dev)-- a managed service and the easiest way to add personal memory and social cognition to your AI applications. Built by the team at Plastic Labs, Honcho enables **ambient personalization** - your AI learns about users automatically as they interact, with no surveys or additional user overhead.

## Why Use the Honcho Dashboard?

The Honcho management platform streamlines machine creation and monitoring so you can focus on building great AI experiences:

**Machine Management Handled**: Run dedicated Honcho instances in seconds with zero infrastructure setup. We handle provisioning, memory, and maintenance automatically.

**Developer-First Tools**: Create and manage API keys, utilize an API playground with a Postman-like experience, get machine status and performance analytics of your Honcho instance.

**Workspace Dashboard**: Create and manage workspaces, peers, and sessions to integrate into your AI applications.

**Production Monitoring**: Real-time analytics, usage metrics, and health monitoring. Track performance and user engagement across all your AI applications.

### **1. Create Your Organization**
Start by creating your account and setting up your organization. Each organization gets isolated workspaces, member access management, and dedicated infrastructure for your Honcho instances.


### **2. Spin up a Honcho Instance & Monitor Performance**
Navigate to the status page to activate your new set of Honcho machines. Your instance is automatically provisioned with a vector database and API endpoints - ready to handle production traffic for your workspace. The status page will show you the state of your machines and let you know when an upgrade becomes available.

### **4. Test with API Playground**
Use our Postman-like API playground to test queries, explore endpoints, and validate your integration. Send requests directly to your Honcho instance and see real-time responses with full request/response logging.

### **5. Create a Workspace**
On the explore page, you can create a workspace for your app to store peers, sessions, and messages.

### **6. Peers & Sessions Management**
Click into a workspace to open up the workspace dashboard. Here you can create peers and sessions, use the chat endpoint and add messages to your peer representations. Utilize your ability to search across all messages in a workspace.

### **7. Peer Utilities & Chat Endpoint**
You can click on a peer to open the utilities. Here there are options to search across all messages for a particular peer, see participating sessions, or edit the metadata for the peer. 
The Chat Endpoint allows you to send a query through the Honcho API to get information about the peer's representation. 
If you include the session ID, the query will be scoped to messages and the representation of a peer within that session.

### **8. Session Dashboard & Get Context**
From the workspace dashboard, navigate to a session to find options to add peers, view messages, and search across all messages for a particular session. 
Here, you also have the ability to 'Get Context' which produces the message history with a tokenized summary of the session. 
This is a great way to get a quick overview of what happened in a session and summaries can be used to enhance session memory, provide further personalization or aid in message prediction.
