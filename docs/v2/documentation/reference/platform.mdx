    Start using the platform to manage Honcho instances for your workspace or app.
</Card>

The quickest way to begin using Honcho in production is with the
[Honcho Cloud Platform](https://app.honcho.dev). Sign up, generate an API key,
and start building with Honcho.

## 1. Go to [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)

Create an account to start using Honcho. If a teammate already uses Honcho, ask
them to invite you to their organization. Otherwise, you'll see a banner
prompting you to create a new one.

</Frame>

Once you've created an organization, you'll be taken to the dashboard and see
the **Get Started** page with integration guidance and links to documentation.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/get-started-copy.png" alt="Honcho Dashboard Getting Started" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Each organization has dedicated infrastructure running to isolate your
workloads. Until you activate a subscription under the
[Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page, the infrastructure will remain
inactive.

## 2. Activate your Honcho instance

Navigate to the [Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page to activate your subscription. Your Honcho instance provisions automatically, and you can monitor the deployment on the [Instance Status](https://app.honcho.dev/status) page until all systems show a green check mark.

You can also upgrade Honcho when new versions are made available directly from the status page.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/upgrade-honcho.png" alt="Upgrade Honcho" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

The **Performance** page provides comprehensive monitoring with usage metrics, health analytics, API response times, and endpoint usage across Honcho.

## 3. Manage API Keys
The [API Keys](https://app.honcho.dev/api-keys) page allows you to create and manage authentication tokens for different environments. You can create admin-level keys with full instance access or scope keys to specific `Workspaces`, `Peers`, or `Sessions`.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/api-keys.png" alt="API Key Management Dashboard" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

## 4. Test with API Playground
The [API Playground](https://app.honcho.dev/playground) provides a Postman-like interface to test queries, explore endpoints, and validate your integration. Authenticate with an API key and send requests directly to your Honcho instance with real-time responses and full request/response logging.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/api-playground.png" alt="API Playground Interface" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

## 5. Workspaces
The [Explore](https://app.honcho.dev/explore) page provides comprehensive `Workspace` management where you can create workspaces and begin exploring the platform. Each `Workspace` serves as a container for organizing your Honcho data.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/explore-honcho.png" alt="Workspace Table" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Click into any workspace to access a general overview of `Peers` and `Sessions`. Here you can quickly create `Peers`, `Sessions`, and add multiple `Peers` to any `Session`. Edit the metadata and configuration for a `Workspace` with the Edit Config button. Click into any entity to navigate to their respective utilities pages or click the expand icon to view Workspace-wide `Peers` and `Sessions` data tables with more details.

## 6. Peer Dashboard & Utilities
Expand the `Peers` list from the `Workspace` dashboard to see a detailed view of `Peers`.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/peer-dash.png" alt="Peer Dashboard" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Click into any peer to navigate to their respective utilities page. Next to the `Peer` name you can edit the [Global Peer Configuration](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/configuration), and in the tabs below, explore all utilities for the `Peer`. 
<img src="/images/app-screenshots/peer-utilities.png" alt="Peer Management Dashboard" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Utilities include:
- **Message search** across all sessions for a `Peer`
- **Dialectic Chat** to query `Peer` representations globally or session-scoped (results vary dependant on the `Peer`'s configuration)

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/chat-endpoint.png" alt="Chat Endpoint" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

- **Session logs** view which `Sessions` the `Peer` is active
- **Peer configuration and metadata management** including [Session-Peer Configuration](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/configuration#session-peer-configuration)

## 7. Session Dashboard & Utilities
Click into the sessions view within a workspace to see a table of all of your `Sessions` data.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/session-dash.png" alt="Sessions Table" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Click into a `Session` to open its utilities page.  

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/session-utilities.png" alt="Session Utilities" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

Here you can:
- **View and add Messages** within the `Session`; filter messages by `Peer`
- **Advanced search** across `Session` messages
- **Peer management** for adding/removing `Peers` and editing a `Peer`'s Session-level configuration
- **Get Context** to generate LLM-ready context with customizable token limits

## 8. Webhooks Integration
The [Webhooks](https://app.honcho.dev/webhooks) page enables Webhook creation and management.
<img src="/images/app-screenshots/webhooks-page.png" alt="Webhooks Dashboard" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" />

## 9. Organization Member Access
The [Members](https://app.honcho.dev/members) page provides organization administration to manage your team's access to Honcho with the ability to grant admin permissions.
