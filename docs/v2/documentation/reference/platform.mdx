<Card title="Sign up to start using Honcho!" icon="rocket" href="https://app.honcho.dev">
    Start using the platform to manage Honcho instances for your workspace or app.
</Card>

The quickest way to begin using Honcho in production is with the 
[Honcho Cloud Platform](https://app.honcho.dev). Sign up, generate an API key,
and start building with Honcho.

## 1. Go to [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)

Create an account to start using Honcho. If a teammate already uses Honcho, ask
them to invite you to their organization; otherwise, you’ll see a banner
prompting you to create a new one.

</Frame>

Once you've created an organization, you'll be taken to the dashboard and see
the welcome page.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/get-started-copy.png" alt="Honcho Dashboard Getting Started"/>

Each organization has dedicated infrastructure running to isolate your
workloads. Until you activate a subscription under the
[Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page, the infrastructure will be
deactivated. You can check the status of your instance by going to the
[Status](https://app.honcho.dev/status) page.

## **2. Set up billing to activate your Honcho instance**

Once you activate your subscription, your Honcho instance provisions
automatically, and you can watch the status page until all systems show a green
check mark.

Here you can monitor your Honcho instance health, usage metrics, and
performance analytics. See request volume, API response times, and endpoint
usage across all your AI applications.

You can also upgrade Honcho when new versions are made available.

## **3. Manage API Keys**
Create and manage API keys for different environments. You can create
admin-level keys that have access to the entire Honcho instance or scope keys
to restrict access to `Workspaces`, `Peers`, or `Sessions`.

## **4. Test with API Playground**
Use our Postman-like API playground to test queries, explore endpoints, and
validate your integration. Send requests directly to your Honcho instance and
see real-time responses with full request/response logging.

## **5. Create a Workspace**
On the explore page, you can see and interact with the data stored in your
Honcho instance. You can create `Workspaces`, `Peers`, `Sessions`, and `Messages`. 

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/explore-honcho.png" alt="Explore Honcho Page" />

## **6. Peers & Sessions Management**
Click into a `Workspace` to open up the `Workspace` dashboard. Here you can create
`Peers` and `Sessions`, use the Dialectic API and add `Messages` to your `Peer`
representations. Utilize your ability to search across all `Messages` in a
`Workspace`.

## **7. Peer Utilities & Chat Endpoint**
Select a `Peer` to open its utilities. From here you can search that `Peer`'s
`Messages`, view participating `Sessions`, or edit its metadata. 

The Chat Endpoint allows you to send a query through the Honcho API to get
information about the `Peer`'s representation. If you include the `Session` ID,
the query will be scoped to `Messages` and the representation of a `Peer`
within that `Session`.

## **8. Session Dashboard & Get Context**
From the workspace dashboard, navigate to a `Session` to find options to add `Peers`, view `Messages`, and search across all `Messages` for a particular session. 

Use the **Get Context** feature to quickly generate output that fits into your
LLM’s context window. Get a subset of messages with an optional summary
based on the token count you input. The [Session Context](../../guides/get-context) guide goes over how to use this in your agents
