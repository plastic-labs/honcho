    Start using the platform to manage Honcho instances for your workspace or app.
</Card>

The quickest way to get started using Honcho in production is to use the
[Honcho Cloud Platform](https://app.honcho.dev), Sign up, get an API key, and
get started using Honcho.

## 1. Go to [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)

Create an account and get started using Honcho. If you have a team member
already on Honcho, have them invite you to their organization, otherwise you'll
see a banner asking you to create a new one.

Dashboard" width="400" />
</Frame>

Once you've created an organization, you'll be taken to the dashboard and see
the welcome page.

Getting Started"/>

Each organization has dedicated infrastructure running to isolate your
workloads. Until you activate a subscription under the
[Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page, the infrastructure will be
deactivated. You can check the status of your instance by going to the
[Status](https://app.honcho.dev/status) page.

## **2. Set up billing to activate your Honcho instance**

Once you've activated your subscription, your Honcho instance will
automatically provision, you can monitor the status refresh until you see a
green checkmark saying all systems are operational.

Here you can monitor your Honcho instance health, usage metrics, and
performance analytics. See request volume, API response times, and endpoint
usage across all your AI applications.

You can also upgrade Honcho when new versions are made available.

## **3. Generate API Keys** 
Create and manage API keys for different environments. You can create admin
level keys that have access to the entire Honcho instance or scope keys to
restrict access to `Workspaces`, `Peers`, or `Sessions`.

## **4. Test with API Playground**
Use our Postman-like API playground to test queries, explore endpoints, and validate your integration. Send requests directly to your Honcho instance and see real-time responses with full request/response logging.

## **5. Create a Workspace**
On the explore page, you can see and interact with the data stored in your
Honcho instance. You can create `Workspaces`, `Peers`, `Sessions`, and `Messages`. 

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/explore-honcho.png" alt="Explore Honcho Page" />

## **6. Peers & Sessions Management**
Click into a `Workspace` to open up the `Workspace` dashboard. Here you can create
`Peers` and `Sessions`, use the Dialectic API and add `Messages` to your `Peer`
representations. Utilize your ability to search across all `Messages` in a
`Workspace`.

## **7. Peer Utilities & Chat Endpoint**
You can click on a `Peer` to open the utilities. Here there are options to search across all `Messages` for a particular `Peer`, see participating `Sessions`, or edit the metadata for the Peer. 
The Chat Endpoint allows you to send a query through the Honcho API to get information about the `Peer`'s representation. 
If you include the `Session` ID, the query will be scoped to `Messages` and the representation of a `Peer` within that `Session`.

## **8. Session Dashboard & Get Context**
From the workspace dashboard, navigate to a `Session` to find options to add `Peers`, view `Messages`, and search across all `Messages` for a particular session. 
Here, you also have the ability to 'Get Context' which produces the message history with a tokenized summary of the `Session`. 
This is a great way to get a quick overview of what happened in a `Session` and summaries can be used to enhance session memory, provide further personalization or aid in message prediction.
