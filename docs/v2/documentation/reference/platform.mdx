    Start using the platform to manage Honcho instances for your workspace or app.
</Card>

The quickest way to begin using Honcho in production is with the
[Honcho Cloud Platform](https://app.honcho.dev). Sign up, generate an API key,
and start building with Honcho.

## 1. Go to [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)

Create an account to start using Honcho. If a teammate already uses Honcho, ask
them to invite you to their organization; otherwise, you'll see a banner
prompting you to create a new one.

</Frame>

Once you've created an organization, you'll be taken to the dashboard and see
the **Get Started** page with integration guidance and links to documentation.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/get-started-copy.png" alt="Honcho Dashboard Getting Started"/>

Each organization has dedicated infrastructure running to isolate your
workloads. Until you activate a subscription under the
[Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page, the infrastructure will be
deactivated.

## 2. Activate your Honcho instance

Navigate to the [Billing](https://app.honcho.dev/billing) page to activate your subscription. Your Honcho instance provisions automatically, and you can monitor the deployment on the [Instance Status](https://app.honcho.dev/status) page until all systems show a green check mark.

The **Performance** page provides comprehensive monitoring with usage metrics, health analytics, API response times, and endpoint usage across all your AI applications.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/performance-analytics.png" alt="Performance Analytics Dashboard" />

You can also upgrade Honcho when new versions are made available directly from the status page.

## 3. Manage API Keys
The [API Keys](https://app.honcho.dev/api-keys) page allows you to create and manage authentication tokens for different environments. You can create admin-level keys with full instance access or scope keys to specific `Workspaces`, `Peers`, or `Sessions`.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/api-keys.png" alt="API Key Management Dashboard" />

## 4. Test with API Playground
The [API Playground](https://app.honcho.dev/playground) provides a Postman-like interface to test queries, explore endpoints, and validate your integration. Send requests directly to your Honcho instance with real-time responses and full request/response logging.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/api-playground.png" alt="API Playground Interface" />

## 5. Workspace Management
The [Workspace](https://app.honcho.dev/workspace) page provides comprehensive workspace management where you can create workspaces and edit their metadata. Each `Workspace` serves as a container for organizing your AI application data.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/explore-honcho.png" alt="Workspace Management Page" />

Click into any workspace to access detailed views with `Peers` and `Sessions`. Here you can quickly create `Peers` or `Sessions` and add or remove `Peers` to any particular `Session`. Click into any entity to navigate to the respective [Sessions](https://app.honcho.dev/sessions) or [Peers](https://app.honcho.dev/peers) dashboards for cross-workspace management.

## 6. Sessions Management
The dedicated [Sessions](https://app.honcho.dev/sessions) page provides a comprehensive interface for managing all sessions across workspaces. Features include:

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/session-dash.png" alt="Sessions Management Page" />

- **Cross-workspace session overview** with filtering
- **Session creation and management** with metadata editing
- **View or Add Messages** within sessions
- **Get Context** feature for generating LLM-ready context with customizable token limits
- **Peer assignment** to sessions
- **Advanced search** across session messages

<Frame>
<img src="/images/app-screenshots/create-message.png" alt="Message Creation Interface" width="400" />
</Frame>

Use the **Get Context** feature to quickly generate output optimized for your LLM's context window, with optional summarization based on your specified token count.

<img src="/images/app-screenshots/get-context.png" alt="Get Context" />

## 7. Peers Management
The [Peers](https://app.honcho.dev/peers) page offers dedicated peer management across all workspaces with advanced utilities:

- **Cross-workspace peer overview** with comprehensive filtering
- **Message search** across all sessions for a particular peer
- **Peer configuration and metadata management** including [Session-Peer Configuration](/v2/documentation/reference/session-peer-configurations)
- **Dialectic Chat** to query peer representations


<img src="/images/app-screenshots/peer-utilities.png" alt="Peer Management Dashboard" />


The Chat Endpoint allows you to query peer representations directly, with optional session scoping for context-aware responses.

## 8. Webhook Integration
The [Webhooks](https://app.honcho.dev/webhooks) page enables Webhook creation and management.
<img src="/images/app-screenshots/webhooks-page.png" alt="Webhooks Dashboard" />

## 9. Organization Member Access
The [Members](https://app.honcho.dev/members) page provides organization administration:

- **Member invitation** with role-based permissions
- **Role management** (admin/member) with permission controls
- **Member removal** and access management
- **Organization overview** with member activity
