The most basic building block of Honcho's data model is the `Message` object.
A `Message` is sent by a `Peer` and saved in a `Session`


<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from honcho import Honcho

  honcho = Honcho()

  peer = honcho.peer("sample-peer")

  session = honcho.session("sample-session")

  message = peer.message("Hello, world!", session_id=session.id)

  session.add_messages([message])
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

  const honcho = new Honcho({});

  const peer = await honcho.peer('sample-peer');

  const session = await honcho.session('sample-session');

  const message = peer.message('Hello, world!');

  await session.addMessages([message]);
```
</CodeGroup>

Once a `Message` is saved in Honcho, it will kick off a background task that
looks at the new data to generate insights about the `Peer` that sent the `Message`

This is the default behavior of Honcho and can be turned off by [configuring the
Peer or Session](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/configuration)

This pattern of having a Peer, Session, and Messages is highly flexible and
works for many different use cases and agent setups. Some use cases may only
need a single Peer, but many Sessions. Others will only use a single `Session`
for their entire app. These are flexible components that work in any situation.

## Chat Bots

A common use case for Honcho to is to build a Chatbot like ChatGPT or Claude.
This this case you can simply

- Make a `Peer` for the User
- Make a `Peer` for the AI

Then you can make a `Session` for each thread of conversation and save
`Messages` from the user and assistant in each turn of conversation
