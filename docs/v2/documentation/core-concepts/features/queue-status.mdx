Whenever `Messages` are stored in Honcho, a background process called the
[Deriver](/docs/v2/documentation/core-concepts/architecture#reasoning-layer) is
triggered to reason about the conversation and generate insights.

The Deriver is an asynchronous process and, depending on load may not immediately
generated insights for the latest message you've sent. To help with this, Honcho
provides several utilities to check the status of the Deriver.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from honcho import Honcho
honcho = Honcho()

status = honcho.get_deriver_status()
honcho.poll_deriver_status()
```

```typescript typescript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

const honcho = new Honcho({});

const status = await honcho.getDeriverStatus();
await honcho.pollDeriverStatus();
```
</CodeGroup>

Output types

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
class DeriverStatus(BaseModel):
    completed_work_units: int
    """Completed work units"""

    in_progress_work_units: int
    """Work units currently being processed"""

    pending_work_units: int
    """Work units waiting to be processed"""

    total_work_units: int
    """Total work units"""

    sessions: Optional[Dict[str, Sessions]] = None
    """Per-session status when not filtered by session"""
```
```typescript TypeScript
Promise<{
    totalWorkUnits: number
    completedWorkUnits: number
    inProgressWorkUnits: number
    pendingWorkUnits: number
    sessions?: Record<string, DeriverStatus.Sessions>
  }>

```
</CodeGroup>

Whenever a `Message` is sent it will generate several tasks. These could
be tasks such as generating insights, cleaning up a representation, summarizing
a conversation etc. These tasks are defined based on who is sending the
message, what `Session` the message is in, and potentially who is observing the
message. We call the combination of these parameters a `work_unit`

This has a few different implications.

- tasks within the same work_unit are processed sequentially, but multiple
work_units will be processed in parallel
- If local representations are turned in a Session then a `Message` will
  generate an additional work unit for every `Peer` that has `observe_others=True`

The `get_deriver_status` and `poll_deriver_status` methods can take additional
parameters to scope the status to a specific work unit

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
def get_deriver_status(
        self,
        observer_id: str | None = None,
        sender_id: str | None = None,
        session_id: str | None = None,
    ) -> DeriverStatus:
```
```typescript TypeScript

export const DeriverStatusOptionsSchema = z.object({
  observerId: z.string().optional(),
  senderId: z.string().optional(),
  sessionId: z.string().optional(),
  timeoutMs: z
    .number()
    .positive('Timeout must be a positive number')
    .optional(),
})

```
</CodeGroup>

Additionally, there are deriver status and polling deriver status methods
available on the `Session` objects in each of the SDKs.

Below are the function signatures for the session level deriver status method

<CodeGroup>
```python python
@validate_call
    def get_deriver_status(
        self,
        observer_id: str | None = None,
        sender_id: str | None = None,
    ) -> DeriverStatus:
```

```typescript TypeScript
async getDeriverStatus(
    options?: Omit<DeriverStatusOptions, 'sessionId'>
  ): Promise<{
    totalWorkUnits: number
    completedWorkUnits: number
    inProgressWorkUnits: number
    pendingWorkUnits: number
    sessions?: Record<string, DeriverStatus.Sessions>
  }>
```
