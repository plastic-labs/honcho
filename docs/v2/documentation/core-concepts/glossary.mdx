## AI Development Basics

Essential terms for developers new to building AI applications.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**  
The AI model that generates text responses, like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama. Think of it as the "brain" that powers your chatbot or AI assistant.

**Prompt**  
The text you send to an AI model to get a response. This includes user messages, system instructions, and any context you provide.

**Token**  
How AI models count and limit text. Roughly 1 token = 0.75 words. Models have token limits (like 4,000 or 128,000 tokens) that determine how much text they can process at once.

**Context Window**  
The maximum amount of text an AI model can "remember" in one conversation. Once you exceed this limit, the model starts "forgetting" earlier parts of the conversation.

**Memory**  
How your AI application remembers information between conversations. Without memory, each conversation starts fresh with no knowledge of previous interactions.

**Context**  
Background information your AI knows about the current situation, user, or conversation. Good context leads to more relevant and personalized responses.

**Personalization**  
Tailoring AI responses to each specific user based on their preferences, history, and behavior patterns.

**Embedding**  
Converting text into numerical vectors that computers can understand and compare. Enables "smart search" that finds similar content based on meaning, not just keywords.

**Session**  
One complete conversation or interaction between a user and your AI. Sessions help organize and maintain context within individual conversations.

**Agent**  
An AI system that can take actions and make decisions, not just generate text responses. Agents can use tools, call APIs, and interact with external systems.

## Context & Memory

How Honcho builds and maintains intelligent context about users and conversations.

**Global Representation**  
Derived context of a specific peer, synthesizing insights from interactions across all sessions, including arbitrary data ingested by this specific peer. With arbitrary data, a global representation can be made independent of sessions.

**Local Representation**  
One peer's persistent context of another based on observed interactions/messages.

## Authentication & Security

Security and access control features.

**Workspace-Scoped Authentication**  
JWT-based authentication system updated to support the workspace/peer/session hierarchy with appropriate access controls.

**Scoped API Keys**  
Authentication tokens that can limit access to specific workspaces, peers, or resources for enhanced security and multi-tenant isolation.

## Technical Terms

Advanced technical concepts for power users.

<Warning>
These concepts require deeper technical understanding and are primarily for advanced implementations.
</Warning>

**Vector Search**  
Finding similar content using cosine similarity between vector embeddings for semantic context retrieval.

**Semantic Search**  
Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching, used for intelligent context assembly.

**Token Allocation**  
Intelligent management of token usage across context retrieval, summarization, and response generation.

**Multi-Tenancy**  
The ability to serve multiple isolated workspaces from a single Honcho instance with complete data separation.

## Cognitive Science Terms

Cognitive science terms that are used throughout the inspiration and implementation of Honcho

**Theory of Mind**  
The ability of a computer to understand, remember, and interact with its own mind, enabling it to form representations of the world and make decisions based on its own knowledge and behavior.

**Social Cognition**
The mental processes by which we perceive, interpret, and respond to information about others and social situations. It includes the encoding, storage, retrieval, and application of social knowledge.
