## AI Development Basics

Essential terms for developers new to building AI applications.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LLM (Large Language Model)">
    The AI model that generates text responses, like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama. Think of it as the "brain" that powers your chatbot or AI assistant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    The text you send to an AI model to get a response. This includes user messages, system instructions, and any context you provide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token">
    How AI models count and limit text. Roughly 1 token = 0.75 words. Models have token limits (like 4,000 or 128,000 tokens) that determine how much text they can process at once.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Window">
    The maximum amount of text an AI model can "remember" in one conversation. Once you exceed this limit, the model starts "forgetting" earlier parts of the conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory">
    How your AI application remembers information between conversations. Without memory, each conversation starts fresh with no knowledge of previous interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context">
    Background information your AI knows about the current situation, user, or conversation. Good context leads to more relevant and personalized responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personalization">
    Tailoring AI responses to each specific user based on their preferences, history, and behavior patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Embedding">
    Converting text into numerical vectors that computers can understand and compare. Enables "smart search" that finds similar content based on meaning, not just keywords.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metadata">
    Extra information attached to your data, like tags, timestamps, or custom properties. Helps organize and filter your content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API (Application Programming Interface)">
    How your application communicates with external services. APIs define what requests you can make and what responses you'll get back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Endpoint">
    A specific URL your application calls to perform an action, like creating a user, sending a message, or retrieving data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session">
    One complete conversation or interaction between a user and your AI. Sessions help organize and maintain context within individual conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent">
    An AI system that can take actions and make decisions, not just generate text responses. Agents can use tools, call APIs, and interact with external systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Honcho Core Concepts

The fundamental building blocks of the Honcho platform.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace">
    A top-level container providing complete isolation between different applications or environments. Workspaces enable multi-tenancy and contain all peers, sessions, and data with workspace-scoped authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Peer">
    A persistent identity within a workspace that represents a conversational participant (human users, AI agents, or other possible entities). Peers maintain persistent context and memory across all their interactions and can be configured with specific behavioral settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session">
    An independent conversation or interaction context that can include multiple peers. Sessions exist independently, allowing persistent context as well as dynamic peer participation and removal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Message">
    A single communication unit within a session, attributed to a specific peer. Messages support rich content, metadata, and automatic background processing for derived insights.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multi-Peer Architecture

Advanced features for complex conversational scenarios.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Peer Sessions">
    Sessions that support multiple participants simultaneously, including humans, AI agents, and other entities. Each peer can have individual configuration settings within the session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Peer Configuration">
    Settings that control how a peer behaves within a session:
    - **observe_me**: Whether this peer's actions are observed and learned from
    - **observe_others**: Whether this peer learns from other participants
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Context & Memory

How Honcho builds and maintains intelligent context about users and conversations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Deriver">
    Honcho's core engine that uses Theory of Mind principles to extract facts, maintain context, and create representations of any given peer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Peer Context">
    Persistent knowledge and preferences associated with a specific peer that spans across all their sessions. This includes personality profiles, preferences, and accumulated facts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Context">
    Conversation-specific memory and context that is scoped to individual sessions, including summaries and session-specific insights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Arbitrary Data">
    Information fed to the deriver to jump-start a representation or provide extra context to a specific peer, independent of natural conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Global Representation">
    Derived context of a specific peer, synthesizing insights from interactions across all sessions, including arbitrary data ingested by this specific peer. With arbitrary data, a global representation can be made independent of sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local Representation">
    One peer's persistent context of another based on their observed interactions or privately ingested arbitrary data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Observer Peer">
    A peer that forms representations of other peers based on their interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Target Peer">
    The peer being observed to inform a representation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Storage & Processing

How Honcho stores and processes conversational data.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dialectic API">
    Natural language interface for making queries about what insights have been derived concerning global and local peer representations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collections">
    Internal storage containers that use vector embeddings (numerical representations of text) to enable semantic search and similarity matching. Collections store insights, facts, and context about peers generated by the Deriver, allowing the Dialectic API to find relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keywords.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Documents">
    Internal pieces of content stored in collections, automatically embedded and searchable via vector similarity. Used internally for context storage and retrieval.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internal Metadata">
    Honcho's internal state information that is not exposed through the API, used for system processing and state management.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Background Processing

How Honcho processes data in the background to build intelligence.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Work Units">
    Discrete processing tasks that replace session-based processing. Work units handle multi-peer scenarios and different task types for more granular processing control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deriver Queue">
    Background processing system that derives insights from interactions, generates peer representations, and maintains context. Processes work units asynchronously.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Queue Status">
    Processing status indicators: **Pending**, **In Progress**, or **Complete**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

Powerful capabilities for sophisticated AI applications.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Batch Operations">
    Enhanced message operations including:
    - Batch message creation
    - Message querying with token and message count limits
    - Efficient bulk data processing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scoped Search & Summary">
    Search and summary functionalities that can be scoped by:
    - Workspace level
    - Peer level
    - Session level
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Retrieval">
    Session context retrieval with automatic summarization and intelligent token allocation management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Peer Paradigm">
    A conversation model where AI entities act as peers rather than traditional assistants, enabling collaborative interactions and shared context development.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication & Security

Security and access control features.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace-Scoped Authentication">
    JWT-based authentication system updated to support the workspace/peer/session hierarchy with appropriate access controls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scoped API Keys">
    Authentication tokens that can limit access to specific workspaces, peers, or resources for enhanced security and multi-tenant isolation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
