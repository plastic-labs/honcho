Almost all agents require, in addition to personalization and memory, a way to quickly prime a context window with a summary of the conversation (in Honcho, this is equivalent to a `session`). The general strategy for summarization is to combine a list of recent messages verbatim with a compressed LLM-generated summary of the older messages not included. Implementing this correctly, in such a way that the resulting context is:

* Exhaustive: the combination of recent messages and summary should cover the entire conversation
* Dynamically sized: the tokens used on both summary and recent messages should be malleable based on desired token usage
* Performant: while creation of the summary by LLM introduces necessary latency, this should never add latency to an arbitrary end-user request

...is a non-trivial problem. Summarization should not be necessary to re-implement for every new agent you build, so Honcho comes with a built-in solution.

### Creating Summaries

Honcho already has an asynchronous task queue for the purpose of deriving facts from messages. This is the ideal place to create summaries where they won't add latency to a message. Currently, Honcho has two configurable summary types: 

* Short summaries: by default, enqueued every 20 messages and given a token limit of 1000
* Long summaries: by default, enqueued every 60 messages and given a token limit of 4000

Both summaries are designed to be exhaustive: when enqueued, they are given the *prior* summary of their type plus every message after that summary. This recursive compression process naturally biases the summary towards recent messages while still covering the entire conversation.

For example, if message 160 in a conversation triggers a short summary, as it would with default settings, the summary task would retrieve the prior short summary (message 140) plus messages 141-160. It would then produce a summary of messages 0-160 and store that in the short summary slot on the session. Every session has a single slot for each summary type: new summaries replace old ones.

It's important to keep in mind that summary tasks run in the background and are not guaranteed to complete before the next message. However, they are guaranteed to complete in order, so that if a user saves 100 messages in a single batch, the short summary will first be created for messages 0-20, then 21-40, and so on, in our desired recursive way.

### Retrieving Summaries

Summaries are retrieved from the session by the `get_context` method. This method has two parameters:

* `summary`: A boolean indicating whether to include the summary in the return type. The default is true.
* `tokens`: An integer indicating the maximum number of tokens to use for the context. **If not provided, `get_context` will retrieve as many tokens as are required to create exhaustive conversation coverage.**

The return type is simply a list of recent messages and a summary if the flag is used. These two components are dynamically sized based on the token limit. Combined, they will always be below the given token limit. Honcho reserves 60% of the context size for recent messages and 40% for the summary.

There's a critical trade-off to understand between exhaustiveness and token usage. Let's go through some scenarios:

* If the *last message* contains more tokens than the context token limit, no summary *or* message list is possible -- both will be empty.

* If the *last few messages* contain more tokens than the context token limit, no summary is possible -- the context will only contain the last 1 or 2 messages that fit in the token limit.

* If the summaries contain more tokens than the context token limit, no summary is possible -- the context will only contain the X most recent messages that fit in the token limit. Note that while summaries will often be smaller than their token limits, avoiding this scenario means passing a higher token limit than the Honcho-configured summary size(s). For this reason, the default token limit for `get_context` is a few times larger than the configured long summary size.

The above scenarios indicate where summarization is not possible -- therefore, the context retrieved will almost certainly **not** be exhaustive.

Sometimes, gaps in context aren't an issue. In these cases, it's best to pass a reasonable token limit depending on your needs. Other cases demand exhaustive context -- don't pass a token limit and just let Honcho retrieve the ideal combination of summary and recent messages. Finally, if you don't care about the conversation at large and just want the last few messages, set `summary` to false and `tokens` to some multiple of your desired message count. Note that context messages are not paginated, so there's a hard limit on the number of messages that can be retrieved (currently 100,000 tokens).

As a final note, remember that summaries are generated asynchronously and therefore may not be available immediately. If you batch-save a large number of messages, assume that summaries will not be available until those messages are processed, which can take seconds to minutes depending on the number of messages and the configured LLM provider. Exhaustive `get_context` calls performed during this time will likely just return the messages in the session.
