```

## üí° Common Patterns

### Basic Conversation Flow

1. **Initialize**: Create peers and start a session
2. **Converse**: Exchange messages between user and assistant
3. **Learn**: Honcho automatically extracts facts from conversations
4. **Remember**: Future conversations use accumulated context
5. **Personalize**: Responses adapt based on learned information

### Advanced Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Multi-User Sessions">
    Implement separate memory contexts for different users or channels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Windows">
    Manage conversation history to stay within LLM token limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fact Management">
    Query and update the knowledge graph programmatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Theory of Mind">
    Use dialectic API to reason about user preferences and mental states
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

```

```text Memory Not Persisting
"The agent isn't remembering conversations between sessions. Here's my session management code: [paste code]. Help me debug this."
```

```text Performance Optimization
"My Honcho queries are slow. Here's my implementation: [paste code]. How can I optimize this?"
```

```text Integration Problems
"I'm trying to integrate Honcho with [SYSTEM] but getting [ERROR]. Here's my approach: [paste code]. What's the correct way to do this?"
```
</CodeGroup>

## üöÄ Next Steps

After your initial setup:

1. **Add Features**: Extend with voice input, web UI, or API endpoints
2. **Improve Memory**: Implement custom fact extraction and retrieval
3. **Scale Up**: Add caching, background processing, and optimization
4. **Deploy**: Move from demo server to production environment
5. **Monitor**: Add logging, metrics, and error tracking

### Key Concepts for AI Prompts
When working with AI assistants, mention these concepts:
- **Core**: "peers, sessions, messages, facts"
- **Advanced**: "dialectic API, theory of mind, context management"
- **Integration**: "LLM context injection, session persistence, multi-user handling"

<Note>
**Pro Tip**: Be specific about your requirements and constraints when prompting AI. The more context you provide, the better the generated code will match your needs.
