Honcho is an AI-native memory library for building agents with [state-of-the-art](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai/research/Introducing-Neuromancer-XR) memory.

It then goes beyond basic memory by reasoning about the stored data
to expand the latent information available to your agent. Agents using Honcho
will understand who they are, who they are interacting with, what happened, and
when it happened â€” all without you having to think about it.

Use it to build

- Highly personalized experiences
- Agents with social cognition
- Agents with rich identity that evolve over time
- Multi-agent systems with complex social dynamics


```python
# Start simple - just add messages
session.add_messages([alice.message("I learn best with examples")])

# Get powerful - query user psychology
insight = peer.chat("How should I explain this concept?")
# > "This user learns best through concrete examples..."
```

Your agents evolve from goldfish to counselor, on the same infrastructure. That's Honcho.

Designed for developers and agents alike:
- **Natural Language Queries**: Chat with Honcho in natural language via the [Dialectic API](../core-concepts/architecture#dialectic-api) and let agents backchannel
- **Automatic Context Management**: Smart summarization that respects token limits
- **Native multi-agent support**: Break out of User/Assistant Paradigms and build complex multi-agent systems
- **Agent-first interfaces**: MCP connections and APIs designed for agents to consume and use as tools
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any LLM or Agent Framework

## How It Works

### Storage

Developers use Honcho to store information about their users and application via
two integrated layers:

**Memory Layer**: Captures all user interactions - messages, preferences, and
behavioral patterns - in a peer-centric data model that scales from individual
conversations to complex multi-agent scenarios. This also queues up messages for
the reasoning layer to process.

**Reasoning Layer**: Continuously analyzes stored interactions to improve the
memories and representation of each `Peer` in the system.

### Retrieval

Once data is stored and generated within Honcho, the API exposes several
different ways to retrieve and use those insights.

**[Dialectic API](/v2/guides/dialectic-endpoint)**: This is the flagship
endpoint that allows developers chat with Honcho about any aspect of each user
in your system to get dynamic, in-context actionable insights.

Example Queries
- "What's the best way to explain technical concepts to this user?"
- "Is this user more task-oriented or relationship-oriented?"
- "What time of day is this user most engaged?"
- "How does this user prefer to receive feedback?"
- "What are this user's core values based on our conversations?"

**[Get Context](/v2/guides/get-context)**: This endpoint abstracts context window
constraints and continuously retrieves the most relevant and recent data from a
conversation. Provide a token budget and Honcho will return a combination of
summaries and messages that provide session context. Use this for creating
long-running conversations. We crafted our summaries to provide the most
[coverage of a session possible](../core-concepts/summarizer).

**[Search](/v2/guides/search)**: This endpoint allows you to search across Honcho
for relevant messages either at the workspace, peer, or session level. This
endpoint uses a hybrid search strategy that combines text search and cosine
similarity.

**[Working Representations](/v2/guides/working-rep)**: Get a cached, snapshot
of a user in the context of a session. Instead of waiting for an LLM to
synthesize an in-context response via the Dialectic endpoint, use this to get
recent insights you can plug into your context window.

## Ideal For

**Personalized AI assistants** that need to understand individual psychology, not just remember conversations.

**Customer-facing agents** that must adapt their approach based on user communication preferences and emotional context.

**Multi-agent systems** where AI needs to understand human collaborators' working styles and decision-making patterns.

**NPCs** where you want autonomous agents with a rich and deep personality that isn't the average sycophantic llm
