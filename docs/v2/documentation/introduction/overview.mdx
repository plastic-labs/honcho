Honcho is an open source memory library with a managed service for building stateful agents. Use it with any model, framework, or architecture. You can represent any kind of entity as a stateful agent--users, AIs, groups of users, and more. Using Honcho as your memory system will earn your agents higher retention, more trust, and help you build data moats to out-compete incumbents.

## What Can I Use Honcho For?

Honcho streamlines the agent building process by offering elegant, flexible primitives for managing context. It also reasons over that context to give developers access to far richer insights only accessible through reasoning. Take the following scenario:

- You find a use case for LLMs that you want to build an application or agent around
- It performs well but fails to retain state on the task, customers, or itself over time
- You laboriously engineer a RAG solution that seems to help
- Then a cycle like this begins...
  - Reports of edge cases, erroneous behavior, and other unpredictable problems that stem from context
  - You launch into an evals rabbithole and build internal benchmarks
  - Re-engineer your entire RAG solution
  - Repeat

All the while usage dwindles, customers churn, and motivation to solve the problem wanes. Break free from this cycle. Honcho is a general solution to context engineering, memory, and statefulness.

## How Honcho Works

Honcho has four core primitives that work together:

- **Workspaces** - Top-level containers that isolate different applications or environments
- **Peers** - Any entity that persists over time (users, agents, objects, and more)
- **Sessions** - Interaction threads between peers with temporal boundaries
- **Messages** - Units of interaction that trigger reasoning

When you write messages to Honcho, they're stored and processed in the background. Custom reasoning models perform formal logical [*reasoning*](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/reasoning) (deduction, induction, abduction) to generate insights about each peer. These insights--observations, conclusions, summaries--are stored as [*representations*](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/representation) that you can query to provide rich context for your agents.

The diagram above shows the flow: agents write messages to Honcho, which triggers reasoning that updates what's stored in representations. Develoers (or agents) can then query to get additional context for their next response.

## Why Reasoning?

Traditional RAG systems retrieve what was explicitly said, but they miss insights that are only accessible by *rigorously thinking* about your data. Static retrieval can't surface implicit connections, struggles when new information contradicts old data, and fails when you need to make predictions under uncertainty.

Honcho uses formal logic to generate new insights by combining premises. This reasoning is AI-native--it performs the rigorous, compute-intensive type of reasoning that humans struggle with, instantly and consistently. The result is memory that goes beyond simple recall to provide truly contextual understanding.

## Get Started

Honcho gives you maximum control over your agent's context and memory. The data model is flexible and composable, the reasoning backend is powerful yet cost-effective, and everything is built to give developers levers to manage token usage, latency, and reasoning depth.
