Honcho gives agents state-of-the-art memory.

It's is a flexible memory library available through a managed platform and an open source package for self-hosting.

Honcho can be thought of in two ways: Honcho Context and Honcho Memory.


## Honcho Context

Building LLM-powered systems is still a massive orchestration problem. Just getting a multi-user application off the ground requires extensive database and infrastructure knowledge. Managing context windows for each respective user and scaling that system is far from trivial.

Honcho offers elegant, flexible primitives for initializing, storing, retrieving, and scaling all the LLM interaction points in your AI app or agent. Easy orchestration, plus unlimited storage and unlimited retrieval, all out-of-the-box.

Don't waste time redundantly building complex systems. Focus on what makes your product unique.

## Honcho Memory

AI users want tasks completed in line with their evolving preferences. They want agents who can learn about them continuously over time. So, agents need as complete a picture of each user as possible on-demand.

Honcho is built around proprietary reasoning models that ensure the right context is always available. They create modular reasoning traces and compose with them to uncover new insights. Scaffolded reasoning is uniquely traversable, enabling fast context assembly, complete with citation, on-the-fly.

All this happens ambiently—Honcho stores and reasons over everything you write to it so it can recall and synthesize anything later.

## Solve Memory

In Honcho, memory is a reasoning task. Beyond static storage and retrieval or naive fact extraction, Honcho arrives at conclusions only accessible via rigorous reasoning.

When your agent needs user context, Honcho returns rich results, drawing on its self-improving body of composable reasoning and synthesizing exactly what's needed.

Memory is table stakes--it's the system that constructs context to make decisions about how to continue. Honcho is a state-of-the-art memory solution built in an AI-native way. Build your agents with a reasoning system that uniquely leverages LLMs to solve memory.
