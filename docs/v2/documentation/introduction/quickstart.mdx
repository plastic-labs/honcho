<Note>
This uses the demo server at https://demo.honcho.dev
</Note>

Install the Honcho client SDK with the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python (uv)
uv add honcho-ai
```

```bash Python (pip)
pip install honcho-ai
```

```bash TypeScript (npm)
npm install @honcho-ai/sdk
```

```bash TypeScript (yarn)
yarn add @honcho-ai/sdk
```

```bash TypeScript (pnpm)
pnpm add @honcho-ai/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

First, import the Honcho client from the package:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from honcho import Honcho
# Initialize client (using the default workspace and demo environment)
client = Honcho()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';
// Initialize client (using the default workspace and demo environment)
const client = new Honcho();
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, we want to create Peers within our instance of Honcho:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
alice = client.peer("alice")
bob = client.peer("bob")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const alice = client.peer("alice")
const bob = client.peer("bob")
```

</CodeGroup>


Create a Session and add our Peers to it:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
session = client.session("session_1")
session.add_peers([alice, bob])
```

```typescript TypeScript
const session = client.session("session_1")
session.addPeers([alice, bob])
```

</CodeGroup>

Add Messages to the Session:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
session.add_messages(
    [
        alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
        bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
        alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
        bob.message("I'm going to the gym!"),
    ]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
session.addMessages([
    alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
    bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
    alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
    bob.message("I'm going to the gym!"),
])
```

</CodeGroup>

You can then chat with Honcho to get a dialectic response, which is informed by the Peer representation that Honcho has constructed from the above Messages:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = alice.chat("What is Bob doing after work?")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await alice.chat("What is Bob doing after work?");
```

</CodeGroup>

This is a super simple overview of how to get up and running with the Honcho SDK. We covered the basic methods for creating peers, sessions, and messages, as well as retrieving basic insights.
For a more detailed look at the SDK, check out the SDK reference [here](../platform/sdk).
