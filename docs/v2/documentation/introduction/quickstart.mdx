For production-level use, Honcho offers two powerful ways to leverage ambient personalization: our managed platform and our open source solution. Read further if you want to explore the quickstart demo.

# Getting Started

Have your project use Honcho's ambient personalization capabilities in just a few steps. No signup required!

<Info>
By default, the SDK uses the demo server hosted at demo.honcho.dev. The demo server is meant for quick experimentation and the data is cleared on a regular basis. Do not use for production applications.

For production use:
1. Get your API key at [app.honcho.dev/api-keys](https://app.honcho.dev/api-keys)
2. Set `environment="production"` and provide your `api_key`
</Info>

## 1. Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python (uv)
uv add honcho-ai
```

```bash Python (pip)
pip install honcho-ai
```

```bash TypeScript (npm)
npm install @honcho-ai/sdk
```

```bash TypeScript (yarn)
yarn add @honcho-ai/sdk
```

```bash TypeScript (pnpm)
pnpm add @honcho-ai/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Initialize the Client

The Honcho client is the main entry point for interacting with Honcho's API. By default, it uses the demo environment and a default workspace.

### Demo Environment (Default)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from honcho import Honcho

# Initialize client (uses demo environment and default workspace)
honcho = Honcho()

```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

// Initialize client (uses demo environment and default workspace)
const honcho = new Honcho({});

```
</CodeGroup>

### Production Environment

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from honcho import Honcho

# Production environment with API key
honcho = Honcho(
    api_key=os.environ["HONCHO_API_KEY"],
    environment="production",
    # Create a workspace, otherwise set to "default"
    # workspaceId="your-workspace-id"
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

// Production environment with API key
const honcho = new Honcho({
    apiKey: process.env.HONCHO_API_KEY!,
    environment: "production",
    // Create a workspace, otherwise set to "default"
    // workspace: "your-workspace-id"
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Create Peers

Peers represent individual users, AI agents, or any conversational entity in your system:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
alice = honcho.peer("alice")
bob = honcho.peer("bob")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const alice = await honcho.peer("alice")
const bob = await honcho.peer("bob")
```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Create a Session

Sessions are independent conversations that can include multiple peers:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
session = honcho.session("session_1")
session.add_peers([alice, bob])
```

```typescript TypeScript
const session = await honcho.session("session_1")
await session.addPeers([alice, bob])
```
</CodeGroup>

## 5. Add Messages

Add some conversation messages. Honcho automatically learns from these interactions:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
session.add_messages([
    alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
    bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
    alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
    bob.message("I'm going to the gym! I've been trying to get back in shape."),
    alice.message("That's great! I should probably start exercising too."),
    bob.message("You should! I find that evening workouts help me relax."),
])
```

```typescript TypeScript
await session.addMessages([
    alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
    bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
    alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
    bob.message("I'm going to the gym! I've been trying to get back in shape."),
    alice.message("That's great! I should probably start exercising too."),
    bob.message("You should! I find that evening workouts help me relax."),
])
```
</CodeGroup>

## 6. Query for Insights

Now ask Honcho what it's learned - this is where the magic happens:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Ask what Bob is like
response = bob.chat("Tell me about Bob's interests and habits")
print(response)

# Returns rich context like:
# "Bob is health-conscious and has been working on getting back in shape.
# He regularly goes to the gym, particularly in the evenings, and finds
# exercise helps him relax. He's encouraging about fitness and willing
# to share advice about workout routines."
```

```typescript TypeScript
bob.chat("Tell me about Bob's interests and habits").then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  // Returns rich context like:
  // "Bob is health-conscious and has been working on getting back in shape.
  // He regularly goes to the gym, particularly in the evenings, and finds
  // exercise helps him relax. He's encouraging about fitness and willing
  // to share advice about workout routines."
})
```
</CodeGroup>

## 7. Putting it all together

    <CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from honcho import Honcho

# Create your client
honcho = Honcho(
    api_key=os.environ["HONCHO_API_KEY"],
    environment="production",
    # Create a workspace, otherwise set to "default"
    # workspaceId="your-workspace-id"
)

# Get your Peers
alice = honcho.peer("alice")
bob = honcho.peer("bob")

# Make a Session and add your Peers
session = honcho.session("session_1")
session.add_peers([alice, bob])

# Add messages sent by your Peers
session.add_messages([
    alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
    bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
    alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
    bob.message("I'm going to the gym! I've been trying to get back in shape."),
    alice.message("That's great! I should probably start exercising too."),
    bob.message("You should! I find that evening workouts help me relax."),
])

# Get insights about your Peers
response = bob.chat("Tell me about Bob's interests and habits")
print(response)

# Returns rich context like:
# "Bob is health-conscious and has been working on getting back in shape.
# He regularly goes to the gym, particularly in the evenings, and finds
# exercise helps him relax. He's encouraging about fitness and willing
# to share advice about workout routines."
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

// Create your client
const honcho = new Honcho({
    apiKey: process.env.HONCHO_API_KEY!,
    environment: "production",
    // Create a workspace, otherwise set to "default"
    // workspace: "your-workspace-id"
});

// Get your Peers
const alice = await client.peer("alice")
const bob = await client.peer("bob")

// Make a Session and add your peers
const session = await client.session("session_1")
await session.addPeers([alice, bob])

// Add messages sent by your Peers
await session.addMessages([
    alice.message("Hi Bob, how are you?"),
    bob.message("I'm good, thank you!"),
    alice.message("What are you doing today after work?"),
    bob.message("I'm going to the gym! I've been trying to get back in shape."),
    alice.message("That's great! I should probably start exercising too."),
    bob.message("You should! I find that evening workouts help me relax."),
])

// Get insights about your peers
bob.chat("Tell me about Bob's interests and habits").then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  // Returns rich context like:
  // "Bob is health-conscious and has been working on getting back in shape.
  // He regularly goes to the gym, particularly in the evenings, and finds
  // exercise helps him relax. He's encouraging about fitness and willing
  // to share advice about workout routines."
})
```
</CodeGroup>

## What Just Happened?

You just got through building a simple conversation between two people, Alice
and Bob. We:

1. Set up our connection to Honcho.
2. Setup who the participants of our conversation are, these are called `Peers`.
3. Made a `Session` and added our `Peers` to it.
4. Sent messages from our `Peers`
5. Chat with Honcho to get insights about one of the `Peers` in the conversation

As soon as you save a message in Honcho, it will start to reason about it to
pull out insights and develop a profile of the user. This is the default
behavior and can be toggled off via [the configuration](/v2/documentation/core-concepts/configuration).
