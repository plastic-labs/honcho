### Prerequisites and Dependencies

Honcho is developed using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

The minimum Python version is `3.9`.

### Setup

Once the dependencies are installed on the system, run the following steps to get
the local project set up.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho.git
```

2. Enter the repository and install the Python dependencies

We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for Honcho
from other projects on the same system. `uv` will create a virtual environment
when you sync your dependencies in the project.

Putting this together:

```bash
cd honcho
uv sync
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies for Honcho.
The default virtual environment will be located at `honcho/.venv`. Activate the
virtual environment via:

```bash
source honcho/.venv/bin/activate
```

3. Set up a database

Honcho utilizes [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its database with
pgvector. An easy way to get started with a PostgreSQL database is to create a project
with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

A `docker-compose` template is also available with a database configuration.

4. Edit the environment variables

Honcho uses a `.env` file for managing runtime environment variables. A
`.env.template` file is included for convenience. Several of the configurations
are not required and are only necessary for additional logging, monitoring, and
security.

Below are the required configurations:

```env
CONNECTION_URI= # Connection URI for a PostgreSQL database
OPENAI_API_KEY= # API Key for OpenAI used for embedding documents
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= # API Key for Anthropic used for the deriver and dialectic API
```
> Note that the `CONNECTION_URI` must have the prefix `postgresql+psycopg` to
> function properly. This is a requirement from `sqlalchemy`.

The template has additional functionality disabled by default. To ensure
that it is disabled, you can verify the following environment variables are
set to false:

```env
USE_AUTH=false
SENTRY_ENABLED=false
```

5. Launch the API

With the dependencies installed, a database set up and enabled with `pgvector`,
and the environment variables configured, you can now launch a local instance of
Honcho. The following command will launch the storage API for Honcho:

```bash
fastapi dev src/main.py
```
This is a development server that will reload whenever code is changed. When
first launching the API with a database connection, it will provision the
necessary tables for Honcho to operate.

### Docker

As mentioned earlier, a `docker-compose` template is included for running Honcho.
As an alternative to running Honcho locally, it can also be run with the compose
template.

Copy the template and update the appropriate environment variables before
launching the service:

```bash
cd honcho
cp .env.template .env
# Update the .env file with your OpenAI key and other desired environment variables
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```
