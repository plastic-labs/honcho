Give Claude Code long-term memory that survives context wipes, session restarts, and `ctrl+c`. Claude remembers what you're working on, your preferences, and what it was doing across all your projects.


## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your Honcho API Key

1. Go to **[app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev)**
2. Sign up or log in
3. Copy your API key (starts with `hch-`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Add these to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile`):

```bash
# Required
export HONCHO_API_KEY="hch-your-api-key-here"

# Optional (defaults shown)
export HONCHO_PEER_NAME="$USER"           # Your name/identity
export HONCHO_WORKSPACE="claude_code"     # Workspace name
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 3: Install the Plugin

<Note>
This plugin requires [Bun](https://bun.sh). If you don't have it: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
</Note>

Open Claude Code and run:

```
/plugin marketplace add plastic-labs/claude-honcho
```

Then install:

```
/plugin install honcho@honcho
```

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code

```bash
# Exit Claude Code (ctrl+c or /exit)
# Start it again
claude
```

**That's it!** You should see the Honcho pixel art and memory loading on startup.

### Step 5: (Optional) Kickstart with an Interview

```
/honcho:interview
```

Claude will interview you about your personal preferences to kickstart a representation of you. What it learns will be saved in Honcho and remembered forever. The interview is specific to the peer name you chose — it carries across different projects!

## What You Get

- **Persistent Memory** — Claude remembers your preferences, projects, and context across sessions
- **Survives Context Wipes** — Even when Claude's context window resets, memory persists
- **Git Awareness** — Detects branch switches, commits, and changes made outside Claude
- **Per-Project Sessions** — Each directory has its own conversation history
- **AI Self-Awareness** — Claude knows what it was working on, even after restarts
- **MCP Tools** — Search memory, query knowledge about you, and save insights

## Teams

Honcho works naturally for teams. Every team member contributes to and retrieves from a shared workspace, while Honcho models each person individually. Your sessions within a repo are scoped to your peer name (`HONCHO_PEER_NAME`), so your memory stays yours even though the workspace is shared.

- **Session naming** is automatic — set to `{user}_{repo}` by default so each team member gets their own session per project
- **Workspace** (`HONCHO_WORKSPACE`) groups all your team's sessions together. Set it to a shared value across the team
- **Peer name** (`HONCHO_PEER_NAME`) identifies you individually within the workspace

This means Claude builds a distinct understanding of each team member's preferences and context while everyone operates in the same workspace.

## Logging

The plugin logs activity to `~/.honcho/` and to Claude Code's verbose mode, so you can see exactly how Honcho is being used — what context is loaded at session start, what messages are saved, and what context is injected into Claude's prompts. Set `HONCHO_LOGGING` to `false` to disable file logging.

## MCP Tools

The plugin provides these tools via MCP:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Semantic search across session messages |
| `chat` | Query Honcho's knowledge about the user |
| `create_conclusion` | Save insights about the user to memory |

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `HONCHO_API_KEY` | **Yes** | — | Your Honcho API key from [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev) |
| `HONCHO_PEER_NAME` | No | `$USER` | Your identity in the memory system |
| `HONCHO_WORKSPACE` | No | `claude_code` | Workspace name (groups your sessions) |
| `HONCHO_CLAUDE_PEER` | No | `claude` | How the AI is identified |
| `HONCHO_ENDPOINT` | No | `production` | `production`, `local`, or a custom URL |
| `HONCHO_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Set to `false` to disable |
| `HONCHO_SAVE_MESSAGES` | No | `true` | Set to `false` to stop saving messages |
| `HONCHO_LOGGING` | No | `true` | Set to `false` to disable file logging to `~/.honcho/` |

## Skills (Slash Commands)

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/honcho:status` | Show current memory status and configuration |
| `/honcho:interview` | Interview to capture stable, cross-project user preferences |

### The Interview

The `/honcho:interview` skill conducts a short interview to learn stable, cross-project aspects about you:

- **Communication style** — Concise answers, detailed explanations, or a mix
- **Tone** — Direct and professional or conversational
- **Structure** — Bullet points, step-by-step, or narrative
- **Technical depth** — Beginner, intermediate, or expert
- **Code quality focus** — Clarity, performance, tests, or minimal changes
- **Collaboration style** — Make changes directly, propose options, or ask first

Each answer is saved as a conclusion in Honcho memory and persists across all your projects.

### Using a local Honcho instance

```bash
export HONCHO_ENDPOINT="local"  # Uses http://localhost:8000/v3
```

## Using Honcho with Claude Desktop

You can also use Honcho with the Claude Desktop app via MCP. This lets Claude manage its own memory in the native desktop experience.

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

Get an API key from [app.honcho.dev](https://app.honcho.dev).

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

<Note>
This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Claude Desktop or Claude Code can help you install it!
</Note>

Navigate to Claude Desktop's custom MCP servers settings and add Honcho:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honcho": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.honcho.dev",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}",
        "--header",
        "X-Honcho-User-Name:${USER_NAME}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <your-honcho-key>",
        "USER_NAME": "<your-name>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Optional customization** — You can also set a custom assistant name and workspace ID:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honcho": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.honcho.dev",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}",
        "--header",
        "X-Honcho-User-Name:${USER_NAME}",
        "--header",
        "X-Honcho-Assistant-Name:${ASSISTANT_NAME}",
        "--header",
        "X-Honcho-Workspace-ID:${WORKSPACE_ID}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <your-honcho-key>",
        "USER_NAME": "<your-name>",
        "ASSISTANT_NAME": "<your-assistant-name>",
        "WORKSPACE_ID": "<your-custom-workspace-id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

Upon relaunch, Honcho should start and the tools will be available.

### Step 4: Add Instructions

The Desktop app doesn't allow system prompts directly, but you can create a project and paste [these instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plastic-labs/honcho/refs/heads/main/mcp/instructions.md) into the "Project Instructions" field.

Claude will then query for insights before responding and write your messages to storage!
