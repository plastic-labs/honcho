<Note> Before you start a guide, follow [Quickstart](/v3/documentation/introduction/quickstart) to get up and running with Honcho in your language of choice. </Note>

These guides provide concrete examples and implementation patterns for building with Honcho. Whether you're integrating Honcho into existing platforms, exploring advanced features, or getting up and running quickly, you'll find working code you can adapt to your needs.

Each guide focuses on a specific use case with practical examples. The goal is to get you from idea to working prototype as quickly as possible, then provide the depth you need to scale and customize.
