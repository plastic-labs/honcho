When working with AI-generated content, streaming the response as it's generated can significantly improve the user experience. Honcho provides streaming functionality in its SDKs that allows your application to display content as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

## When to Use Streaming

Streaming is particularly useful for:

- Real-time chat interfaces
- Long-form content generation
- Applications where perceived speed is important
- Interactive agent experiences
- Reducing time-to-first-word in user interactions

## Streaming with the Chat Endpoint

One of the primary use cases for streaming in Honcho is with the [chat endpoint](/v3/documentation/features/chat). This allows you to stream the AI's reasoning about a user in real-time.

### Prerequisites

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from honcho import Honcho

# Initialize client (using the default workspace)
honcho = Honcho()

# Create or get peers
user = honcho.peer("demo-user")
assistant = honcho.peer("assistant")

# Create a new session
session = honcho.session("demo-session")

# Add peers to the session
session.add_peers([user, assistant])

# Store some messages for context (optional)
session.add_messages([
    user.message("Hello, I'm testing the streaming functionality")
])
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

(async () => {
    // Initialize client (using the default workspace)
    const honcho = new Honcho({});

    // Create or get peers
    const user = await honcho.peer('demo-user');
    const assistant = await honcho.peer('assistant');

    // Create a new session
    const session = await honcho.session('demo-session');

    // Add peers to the session
    await session.addPeers([user, assistant]);

    // Store some messages for context (optional)
    await session.addMessages([
      user.message("Hello, I'm testing the streaming functionality")
    ]);
})();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Streaming from the Chat Endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import time

# Basic streaming example
response_stream = user.chat("What can you tell me about this user?", stream=True)

for chunk in response_stream.iter_text():
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)  # Print each chunk as it arrives
    time.sleep(0.01)  # Optional delay for demonstration
```

```typescript TypeScript
(async () => {
    // Basic streaming example
    const responseStream = await user.chat("What can you tell me about this user?", {
      stream: true
    });

    // Process the stream
    for await (const chunk of responseStream.iter_text()) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);  // Write to console without newlines
    }
})();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Working with Streaming Data

When working with streaming responses, consider these patterns:

1. **Progressive Rendering** - Update your UI as chunks arrive instead of waiting for the full response
2. **Buffered Processing** - Accumulate chunks until a logical break (like a sentence or paragraph)
3. **Token Counting** - Monitor token usage in real-time for applications with token limits
4. **Error Handling** - Implement appropriate error handling for interrupted streams

## Example: Restaurant Recommendation Chat

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import asyncio
from honcho import Honcho

async def restaurant_recommendation_chat():
    # Initialize client
    honcho = Honcho()

    # Create peers
    user = honcho.peer("food-lover")
    assistant = honcho.peer("restaurant-assistant")

    # Create session
    session = honcho.session("food-preferences-session")

    # Add peers to session
    await session.add_peers([user, assistant])

    # Store multiple user messages about food preferences
    user_messages = [
        "I absolutely love spicy Thai food, especially curries with coconut milk.",
        "Italian cuisine is another favorite - fresh pasta and wood-fired pizza are my weakness!",
        "I try to eat vegetarian most of the time, but occasionally enjoy seafood.",
        "I can't handle overly sweet desserts, but love something with dark chocolate."
    ]

    # Add the user's messages to the session
    session_messages = [user.message(message) for message in user_messages]
    await session.add_messages(session_messages)

    # Print the user messages
    for message in user_messages:
        print(f"User: {message}")

    # Ask for restaurant recommendations based on preferences
    print("\nRequesting restaurant recommendations...")
    print("Assistant: ", end="", flush=True)
    full_response = ""

    # Stream the response using the user's peer to get recommendations
    response_stream = user.chat(
        "Based on this user's food preferences, recommend 3 restaurants they might enjoy in the Lower East Side.",
        stream=True,
        session_id=session.id
    )

    for chunk in response_stream.iter_text():
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        full_response += chunk
        await asyncio.sleep(0.01)

    # Store the assistant's complete response
    await session.add_messages([
        assistant.message(full_response)
    ])

# Run the async function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(restaurant_recommendation_chat())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Honcho } from '@honcho-ai/sdk';

(async () => {
    async function restaurantRecommendationChat() {
      // Initialize client
      const honcho = new Honcho({});

      // Create peers
      const user = await honcho.peer('food-lover');
      const assistant = await honcho.peer('restaurant-assistant');

      // Create session
      const session = await honcho.session('food-preferences-session');

      // Add peers to session
      await session.addPeers([user, assistant]);

      // Store multiple user messages about food preferences
      const userMessages = [
        "I absolutely love spicy Thai food, especially curries with coconut milk.",
        "Italian cuisine is another favorite - fresh pasta and wood-fired pizza are my weakness!",
        "I try to eat vegetarian most of the time, but occasionally enjoy seafood.",
        "I can't handle overly sweet desserts, but love something with dark chocolate."
      ];

      // Add the user's messages to the session
      const sessionMessages = userMessages.map(message => user.message(message));
      await session.addMessages(sessionMessages);

      // Print the user messages
      for (const message of userMessages) {
        console.log(`User: ${message}`);
      }

      // Ask for restaurant recommendations based on preferences
      console.log("\nRequesting restaurant recommendations...");
      process.stdout.write("Assistant: ");
      let fullResponse = "";

      // Stream the response using the user's peer to get recommendations
      const responseStream = await user.chat(
        "Based on this user's food preferences, recommend 3 restaurants they might enjoy in the Lower East Side.",
        {
          stream: true,
          sessionId: session.id
        }
      );

      for await (const chunk of responseStream.iter_text()) {
        process.stdout.write(chunk);
        fullResponse += chunk;
      }

      // Store the assistant's complete response
      await session.addMessages([
        assistant.message(fullResponse)
      ]);
    }

    await restaurantRecommendationChat();
})();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Performance Considerations

When implementing streaming:

- Consider connection stability for mobile or unreliable networks
- Implement appropriate timeouts for stream operations
- Be mindful of memory usage when accumulating large responses
- Use appropriate error handling for network interruptions

Streaming responses provide a more interactive and engaging user experience. By implementing streaming in your Honcho applications, you can create more responsive AI-powered features that feel natural and immediate to your users.
