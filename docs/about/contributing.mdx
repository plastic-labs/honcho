This project is completely open source and welcomes any and all open source
contributions. The workflow for contributing is to make a fork of the
repository. You can claim an issue in the issues tab or start a new thread to
indicate a feature or bug fix you are working on. 

Once you have finished your contribution make a PR pointed at the `staging`
branch, and it will be reviewed by a project manager. Feel free to join us in
our [discord](http://discord.gg/plasticlabs) to discuss your changes or get
help. 

Once your changes are accepted and merged into staging they will undergo a
period of live testing before entering the upstream into `main`
