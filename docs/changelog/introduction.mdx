        </Update>

        <Update label="v2.0.2">
        ### Fixed

        </Update>

        <Update label="v2.0.1">
        ### Added

        - Ergonomic SDKs for Python and TypeScript (uses Stainless underneath)
        - Deriver Queue Status endpoint
        - Complex arbitrary filters on workspace/session/peer/message
        - Message embedding table for full semantic search

        ### Changed

        - Overhauled documentation
        - BasedPyright typing for entire project
        - Resource filtering expanded to include logical operators

        ### Fixed

        - Various bugs
        - Use new config arrangement everywhere
        - Remove hardcoded responses
        </Update>

        <Update label="v2.0.0">
        ### Added

        - Ability to get a peer's working representation
        - Metadata to all data primitives (Workspaces, Peers, Sessions, Messages)
        - Internal metadata to store Honcho's state no longer exposed in API
        - Batch message operations and enhanced message querying with token and message count limits
        - Search and summary functionalities scoped by workspace, peer, and session
        - Session context retrieval with summaries and token allocatio
        - HNSW Index for Documents Table
        - Centralized Configuration via Environment Variables or config.toml file

        ### Changed

        - New architecture centered around the concept of a "peer" replaces the former
        "app"/"user"/"session" paradigm
        - Workspaces replace "apps" as top-level namespace
        - Peers replace "users"
        - Sessions no longer nested beneath peers and no longer limited to a single
        user-assistant model. A session exists independently of any one peer and
        peers can be added to and removed from sessions.
        - Dialectic API is now part of the Peer, not the Session
        - Dialectic API now allows queries to be scoped to a session or "targeted"
        to a fellow peer
        - Database schema migrated to adopt workspace/peer/session naming and structure
        - Authentication and JWT scopes updated to workspace/peer/session hierarchy
        - Queue processing now works on 'work units' instead of sessions
        - Message token counting updated with tiktoken integration and fallback heuristic
        - Queue and message processing updated to handle sender/target and task types for multi-peer scenarios

        ### Fixed

        - Improved error handling and validation for batch message operations and metadata
        - Database Sessions to be more atomic to reduce idle in transaction time

        ### Removed

        - Metamessages removed in favor of metadata
        - Collections and Documents no longer exposed in the API, solely internal
        - Obsolete tests for apps, users, collections, documents, and metamessages
        ---
        </Update>
