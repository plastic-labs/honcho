If you're happy with how things are working locally, deploying your Honcho instance is a breeze with [Fly](https://fly.io). Follow the [Fly.io Docs](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/) to setup your environment and the `flyctl`.

Once `flyctl` is set up use the the following commands to launch the application:

```bash
cd honcho/api
flyctl launch --no-deploy # Follow the prompts and edit as you see fit
cat .env | flyctl secrets import # Load in your secrets
flyctl deploy # Deploy with appropriate environment variables
```

Then you should have a new URL to initialize your Honcho client with! Consider your user context managed ðŸª„.`
