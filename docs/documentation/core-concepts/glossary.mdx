# Glossary

## Core Entities

### App
A top-level container that represents your application. All users, sessions, and data are organized under an app.

### User
An individual entity within your application. Users can have multiple sessions and collections.

### Session
A conversation or interaction context between a user and your AI application. Sessions contain messages and can span multiple conversations.

### Message
A single communication unit within a session, either from the user or the AI assistant.

### Metamessage
Additional metadata or derived information attached to a message, such as summaries, facts, or analysis.

## Storage & Memory

### Collection
A user-scoped container for storing documents and embeddings. Think of it as a personal knowledge base for each user.

### Document
A piece of content stored in a collection, automatically embedded and searchable via vector similarity.

### Vector Embedding
Numerical representations of text that enable semantic search and similarity matching.

### Metadata
Key-value pairs attached to any entity for additional context and filtering.

## APIs & Components

### Storage API
The core REST API for managing apps, users, sessions, messages, collections, and documents.

### Deriver
A component that processes and derives insights from user interactions, creating metamessages and extracting facts.

### Dialectic API
An advanced conversation management layer that handles turn-taking, context management, and response generation.

## Features

### Peer Paradigm
A conversation model where the AI acts as a peer rather than a traditional assistant, enabling more natural interactions.

### Queue Status
Real-time status tracking for background processing and async operations.

### Scoped API Keys
Authentication tokens that limit access to specific apps, users, or resources for enhanced security.

## Technical Terms

### Vector Search
Finding similar content using cosine similarity between vector embeddings.

### Semantic Search
Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.

### Context Window
The amount of conversation history available to the AI model at any given time.

### User Context
The accumulated knowledge and preferences associated with a specific user across all their interactions.
