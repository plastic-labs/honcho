### Workspace
A top-level container providing complete isolation between different applications or environments. Workspaces enable multi-tenancy and contain all peers, sessions, and data with workspace-scoped authentication.

### Peer
A persistent identity within a workspace that represents a conversational participant (human users, AI agents, or other possible entities). Peers maintain persistent context and memory across all their interactions and can be configured with specific behavioral settings.

### Session
An independent conversation or interaction context that can include multiple peers. Sessions exist independently, allowing persistent context as well as dynamic peer participation and removal.

### Message
A single communication unit within a session, attributed to a specific peer. Messages support rich content, metadata, and automatic background processing for derived insights.

 
## Multi-Peer Architecture

### Multi-Peer Sessions
Sessions that support multiple participants simultaneously, including humans, AI agents, and other entities. Each peer can have individual configuration settings within the session.

### Peer Configuration
Settings that control how a peer behaves within a session:
- **observe_me**: Whether this peer's actions are observed and learned from
- **observe_others**: Whether this peer learns from other participants


## Context & Memory


### The Deriver 
Honcho's core engine that uses Theory of Mind principles to extract facts, maintain context, and create represtations of any given peer.

### Peer Context
Persistent knowledge and preferences associated with a specific peer that spans across all their sessions. This includes personality profiles, preferences, and accumulated facts.

### Session Context
Conversation-specific memory and context that is scoped to individual sessions, including summaries and session-specific insights.

### Arbitrary Data
Ingested information fed to the deriver to jump-start a representation or provide extra context to a specific peer.

### Global Representation
Derived context of a specific peer, synthesizing insights from interactions across all sessions, including arbitrary data ingested by this specific peer. With arbitrary data, a global representation can be made independent of sessions.

### Local Representation
One peer's persistant context of another based on their observed interactions or privately ingested arbitrary data. **** Can you give specific arbitrary data to a local representation? 

### Observer Peer
Forms representations of other peers. 

### Target Peer
The peer being observed to inform a representation.




## Storage & Processing

### Dialectic API
Natural language interface for making queries about what insights have been derived concerning global and local peer representations. 

### Collections
Internal storage containers that use vector embeddings (numerical representations of text) to enable semantic search and similarity matching. Collections store insights, facts, and context about peers generated by the Deriver, allowing the Dialectic API to find relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

### Documents
Internal pieces of content stored in collections, automatically embedded and searchable via vector similarity. Used internally for context storage and retrieval.

### Metadata
Custom data fields (name-value pairs) that can be added to workspaces, peers, sessions, or messages to store additional information for organization, filtering, and application-specific needs. 

### Internal Metadata
Honcho's internal state information that is not exposed through the API, used for system processing and state management.

## Background Processing

### Work Units
Discrete processing tasks that replace session-based processing. Work units handle multi-peer scenarios and different task types for more granular processing control.

### Deriver Queue
Background processing system that derives insights from interactions, generates peer representations, and maintains context. Processes work units asynchronously.

### Queue Status
Processing status indicators: **Pending**, **In Progress**, or **Complete**.






## Advanced Features

### Batch Operations
Enhanced message operations including:
- Batch message creation
- Message querying with token and message count limits
- Efficient bulk data processing

### Scoped Search & Summary
Search and summary functionalities that can be scoped by:
- Workspace level
- Peer level  
- Session level

### Context Retrieval
Session context retrieval with automatic summarization and intelligent token allocation management.

### Peer Paradigm
A conversation model where AI entities act as peers rather than traditional assistants, enabling collaborative interactions and shared context development.


## Authentication & Security

### Workspace-Scoped Authentication
JWT-based authentication system updated to support the workspace/peer/session hierarchy with appropriate access controls.

### Scoped API Keys
Authentication tokens that can limit access to specific workspaces, peers, or resources for enhanced security and multi-tenant isolation.


## Technical Terms

### Vector Search
Finding similar content using cosine similarity between vector embeddings for semantic context retrieval.

### Semantic Search
Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching, used for intelligent context assembly.

### Context Window
The amount of conversation history and peer context available to the AI model for response generation.

### Token Allocation
Intelligent management of token usage across context retrieval, summarization, and response generation.

### Multi-Tenancy
The ability to serve multiple isolated workspaces from a single Honcho instance with complete data separation.
