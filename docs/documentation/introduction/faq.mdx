## General Questions

### What is Honcho?

Honcho is an open-source memory management system designed for AI applications. It provides persistent storage for user conversations, automatic insight derivation, and context-aware response capabilities.

### How is Honcho different from other memory systems?

Honcho offers:
- **Hierarchical Architecture**: Workspaces → Peers / Sessions → Messages
- **Background Processing**: Automatic insight derivation through the deriver system
- **Contextual API**: The Dialectic API provides AI-powered contextual responses
- **Vector Storage**: Semantic search capabilities with embedding-based storage
- **Multi-tenant**: Complete workspace isolation for enterprise use

### Is Honcho open source?

Yes! Honcho is fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho).

### What programming languages does Honcho support?

Honcho provides:
- **REST API**: Language-agnostic HTTP API
- **Python SDK**: Official Python client library
- **Node.js SDK**: Official Node.js client library

## Technical Questions

### What databases does Honcho support?

Honcho is built on PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for vector storage. This provides:
- Scalable relational data storage
- Vector similarity search
- ACID compliance
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

### How does the deriver system work?

The deriver system automatically processes user interactions in the background to:
1. Generate user personality profiles and preferences
2. Create conversation summaries
3. Extract factual information
4. Maintain contextual awareness

Messages are queued automatically and processed by worker processes.

### What AI models does Honcho use?

Honcho integrates with:
- **OpenAI**: For embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) and language models
- **Anthropic**: For advanced reasoning and analysis
- **Groq**: For fast inference
- **Custom Models**: Extensible to support any LLM provider

### How does authentication work?

Honcho uses JWT-based authentication with hierarchical scoping:
- **Admin tokens**: Full system access
- **Workspace tokens**: Access to specific workspaces
- **Peer tokens**: Access to specific peers
- **Session tokens**: Access to specific sessions

## Deployment Questions

### Can I self-host Honcho?

Yes! Honcho is designed for self-hosting. You can deploy it:
- **Locally**: Using Docker Compose
- **Cloud**: On AWS, GCP, Azure, or any cloud provider
- **Kubernetes**: Using our provided Helm charts
- **Fly.io**: Using our fly.toml configuration

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 2 CPU cores
- 4GB RAM
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector
- 20GB storage

**Recommended for Production:**
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM
- High-performance SSD storage
- Load balancer for API servers
- Separate deriver worker instances

### How do I scale Honcho?

Honcho can be scaled horizontally:
- **API Servers**: Stateless, scale behind load balancer
- **Deriver Workers**: Add more worker processes for background processing
- **Database**: Use read replicas and connection pooling
- **Caching**: Add Redis for frequently accessed data

## Data and Privacy

### How is user data stored?

User data is stored in PostgreSQL with:
- **Workspace Isolation**: Complete data separation
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access logs
- **Backup**: Regular automated backups

### Can I export my data?

Yes! You can export data through:
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic data access
- **Database Export**: Direct PostgreSQL export
- **Bulk Operations**: Batch export utilities

### Is Honcho GDPR compliant?

Honcho provides tools for GDPR compliance:
- **Data Export**: Right to data portability
- **Data Deletion**: Right to be forgotten
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging

However, compliance depends on how you implement and configure your deployment.

## Development Questions

### How do I get started with development?

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up local environment with Docker
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run database migrations
5. Start the API server and deriver workers

See our [Quick Start Guide](/documentation/introduction/quickstart) for detailed instructions.

### Can I contribute to Honcho?

Absolutely! We welcome contributions:
- **Bug Reports**: Open issues on GitHub
- **Feature Requests**: Discuss in GitHub discussions
- **Pull Requests**: Submit code improvements
- **Documentation**: Help improve docs

See our [Contributing Guide](/documentation/about/contributing) for details.

### How do I debug issues?

**Enable Debug Logging:**
```bash
HONCHO_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m src.main
```

**Check Queue Status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/peers/{peer}/deriver/status
```

**Monitor Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM queue WHERE processed = false;
```

### What testing tools are available?

Honcho includes comprehensive testing:
- **Unit Tests**: pytest-based test suite
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing
- **Load Testing**: Performance benchmarking tools
- **Mock Services**: Local testing without external APIs

## API Questions

### What's the difference between REST API and SDKs?

- **REST API**: Direct HTTP endpoints, language-agnostic
- **SDKs**: Type-safe wrappers with convenience methods
- **Both**: Support the same functionality, SDKs provide better developer experience

Currently Honcho has official SDKs for Python and TypeScript.

### Are there rate limits?

Rate limiting depends on your deployment:
- **Self-hosted**: Configure rate limits as needed
- **Hosted Service**: Contact us for enterprise plans
- **Development**: No limits on local development

### How do I handle API errors?

Common error codes:
- **400**: Bad Request - Check request format
- **401**: Unauthorized - Check authentication
- **404**: Not Found - Verify resource exists
- **429**: Rate Limited - Implement backoff and retry logic
- **500**: Server Error - Check logs

### Can I use webhooks?

Webhooks are planned for future releases. Currently, you can:
- Poll the deriver status endpoint
- Use real-time subscriptions (coming soon)
- Monitor database changes directly

## Performance Questions

### How fast is message processing?

Processing speed depends on:
- **Message volume**: Higher volume may have delays
- **Content complexity**: Complex analysis takes longer
- **Worker capacity**: More workers = faster processing
- **External APIs**: OpenAI rate limits affect speed

Typical processing: 1-5 seconds per message.

### Can Honcho handle high volume?

Yes! Honcho is designed for scale:
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking API operations
- **Queue System**: Handle burst traffic
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances as needed
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries and indexing

### How do I optimize performance?

**API Performance:**
- Use connection pooling
- Enable caching layers
- Batch operations when possible

**Deriver Performance:**
- Scale worker processes
- Tune batch sizes
- Monitor queue depth

**Database Performance:**
- Use read replicas
- Optimize queries
- Regular maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Failed**
- Check PostgreSQL is running
- Verify connection string
- Ensure pgvector extension is installed

**Deriver Not Processing**
- Check worker processes are running
- Verify OpenAI API key
- Monitor for error logs

**High Memory Usage**
- Tune worker batch sizes
- Check for memory leaks
- Monitor garbage collection

**API Timeouts**
- Increase timeout values
- Check database performance
- Monitor external API calls
