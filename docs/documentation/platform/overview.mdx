## Welcome to Honcho!

The Honcho Platform is a managed service and the easiest way to add personal memory and identity to your AI applications. Built by the team at Plastic Labs, Honcho enables **ambient personalization** - your AI learns about users automatically as they interact, with no surveys or additional user overhead.

## Why Use the Honcho Dashboard?

The Honcho management platform streamlines deployment and monitoring so you can focus on building great AI experiences:

**One-Click Deployment**: Launch dedicated Honcho instances in seconds with zero infrastructure setup. We handle provisioning, scaling, and maintenance automatically.

**Developer-First Tools**: Create and manage API keys, utilize an API playground with a Postman-like experience, get machine status and performance analytics of your Honcho instance.

**Production Monitoring**: Real-time analytics, usage metrics, and health monitoring. Track performance and user engagement across all your AI applications.

## Go to app.honcho.dev

Get up and running with Honcho in minutes through our managed platform:

### **1. Sign Up & Create Your Organization**
Start by creating your account and setting up your organization. Each organization gets isolated workspaces, team management, and dedicated infrastructure for your Honcho instances.

### **2. Deploy Your Honcho Instance**
One-click deployment creates a dedicated Honcho instance on Fly.io infrastructure. Your instance is automatically provisioned with PostgreSQL + pgvector, background workers, and API endpoints - ready to handle production traffic for your workspace.

### **3. Generate API Keys** 
Create and manage API keys for different environments (development, staging, production). Each key provides secure access to your Honcho instance with granular permissions and usage tracking.

### **4. Test with API Playground**
Use our Postman-like API playground to test queries, explore endpoints, and validate your integration. Send requests directly to your Honcho instance and see real-time responses with full request/response logging.

### **5. Monitor Performance & Machine Status**
Track your Honcho instance health, usage metrics, and performance analytics. Monitor API response times, background processing queues, memory usage, and user engagement across all your AI applications.

## What's Happening Under the Hood

```mermaid

graph LR
    User[User Interacts] --> App[Your AI App]
    App --> Honcho[Honcho API]
    Honcho --> Theory[Theory of Mind<br/>Processing]
    Theory --> Profile[Living User<br/>Representation]
    Profile --> Context[Rich Context<br/>for AI]
    Context --> App


```

**1. Users interact naturally** with your AI application  
**2. Honcho processes interactions via** using advanced theory of mind inference  
**3. Builds living representations** of each user's psychology, preferences, and identity  
**4. Provides rich context** to your AI when needed, in natural language


**Memory Engine Architecture**
- Hierarchical data storage (Workspaces → Peers / Sessions → Messages)
- Vector similarity search for semantic queries
- Metadata indexing for fast retrieval
- Automatic data organization and cleanup


```python
import honcho

# Initialize client
client = honcho.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Create a workspace for your app
workspace = client.workspaces.create(name="My AI App")

# Create a peer (user)
peer = client.peers.create(
    workspace_id=workspace.id,
    name="user_123"
)

# Get personalized context for AI response
context = client.dialectic.query(
    workspace_id=workspace.id,
    peer_id=peer.id,
    query="What communication style does this user prefer?"
)
# Returns rich, nuanced context about the user
```
