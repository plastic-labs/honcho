Honcho will do automatic reasoning for you to derive facts about users and
allow your own agents to use them to reason about the user's needs. There are
two aspects to this:

1. Automatic Fact Derivation
2. Dialectic Endpoint

## Automatic Fact Derivation

When you are saving conversations in sessions and messages via Honcho an automatic callback is run that 
will reason about the conversations and store facts in a `collection` named **Honcho**. This is a reserved `collection`
specifically for the backend Honcho agent to interact with. 

These facts are derived asynchonously and automatically as your users interact with your agents. 

## Dialectic Endpoint

You can make use the automatically derived facts in the `Honcho` collection directly by querying the documents stored in it, 
but an alternative is to use the *Dialectic Endpoint`. What this is, is an endpoint that allows you to talk to an agent that 
can automatically take the collection into their context and reason about the users with you. 

This chat interface is exposed via the `Sessions` object. 

Belows is some example code on how this works. 

```python
from honcho import Honcho

honcho = Honcho(app_name="demo")
honcho.initialize()

# create or get user
user = honcho.create_or_get_user("demo-user")

# create or get session
session = honcho.create_or_get_session(user, "demo-session")

# Talk to the dialectic agent to reason about their needs
answer = session.chat("What is the user's favorite way of completing the task")
```
