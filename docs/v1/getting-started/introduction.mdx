Honcho is an infrastructure layer that empowers AI agents with social cognition and deeper understanding of their users.

The API is built on two core concepts: *Storage* and *Insights*. The Storage API provides a flexible memory framework that can store both chat conversations and vector embeddings of user interactions. This forms the foundation for building more socially aware agents.

The Insights layer analyzes these stored interactions to build rich user profiles, which can be queried through a natural language dialectic endpoint. This allows agents to develop a nuanced understanding of users' preferences, behaviors, and needs over time.

By handling the complex infrastructure needed for memory and user understanding, Honcho lets you focus on building amazing AI experiences. No more worrying about how to scale personalization - we've got you covered.
