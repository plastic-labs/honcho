This project is completely open source and welcomes any and all open source
contributions. The workflow for contributing is to make a fork of the
repository. You can claim an issue in the issues tab or start a new thread to
indicate a feature or bug fix you are working on.

Once you have finished your contribution make a PR , and it will be reviewed by
a project manager. Feel free to join us in our
[discord](http://discord.gg/plasticlabs) to discuss your changes or get help.

Your changes will undergo a period of testing and discussion before finally
being entered into the `main` branch and being staged for release. For more
details, check out our [contributing](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
document.
