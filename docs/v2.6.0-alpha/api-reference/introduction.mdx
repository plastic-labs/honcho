This section documents all available API endpoints in the Honcho Server. Each
endpoint provides CRUD operations for our core primitives. For information
about these primitives, see
[Architecture](/v2.6.0-alpha/documentation/core-concepts/architecture).

<Warning>
  We strongly recommend using our official SDKs instead of calling these APIs directly. The SDKs provide better error handling, type safety, and developer experience.
</Warning>

## Recommended approach

Use our official SDKs for the best development experience:
- [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/honcho-ai/)
- [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@honcho-ai/sdk)

## When to use this API reference

This reference is primarily useful for:
- Debugging SDK behavior
- Building integrations in unsupported languages
- Understanding the underlying data structures

The endpoints pages are autogenerated and include interactive examples for testing.
